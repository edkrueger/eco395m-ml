# Homework 1 (10 Points + 3 Bonus)

Create a private repo called `eco395m-ml-student` and invite the TA and I. Make a folder called `1-homework`. For exercises containing programming, take the starter code (if there is any) and move it into the folder and solve. For written exercises (including mathematical ones) either submit the solution as a neatly written scan or picture or a markdown file (containing LaTeX). Inside a file called `README.md` in the homework folder, indicate which file, images etc. contain which solutions.

1. (2 points) **Solve for closed from coefficients in Univariate Linear Regression**: In class we solved univariate linear regression for $\beta_{0}$ in terms of $\beta_{1}$. Use this result and the first order conditions for $\beta_{1}$ to solve for $\beta_{0}$ and $\beta_{1}$ in terms of $x_{i}$ and $y_{i}$. Can you write this in terms of statistics operators/functions/variables?  
2. (1 point) Do ISL 3.7.5
3. (1 point) Do ISL 3.7.6
4. **Implement OOP Triangles**: In `homework/1-homework/triangles` there is a file called `base_triangle.py` containing a base class of triangles called `BaseTriangle`. In `oop_triangles.py` you will implement `IsoscelesTriangle` and `RightTriangle` which both inherit from `BaseTriangle`. You should be able to do so without overriding any methods inherited from `BaseTriangle`. You'll know your code work when it passes the assertions made in `if __name__ == "__main__"` block of the code. Do not modify the assertions.
    * a. (1 point) Finish implementing IsoscelesTriangle.
    * b. (1 point) Implement RightTriangle.
5. **Implement KNN*: In `homework/1-homework/diy_regressor/knn.py` you'll implement KNN is the style of a scikit-learn regressor. You can test your implementation by running the code and seeing if the assertions under `if __name__ == "__main__"` pass. You can also calculate the MSE against a real dataset by running `main_diy.py`. Do not modify the assertions.
    * a. (3 points) Implement KNN
    * b. (1 point) When running against the dataset in `main_diy.py` what effect does changing k have? What k is results in the lower MSE?
  
**Bonus**
(3 points) **Weighted KNN**: In class, Jisoo suggested an alternative algorithm for KNN: instead of predicting an average of the targets for the k-closest observations to the input observation, predict a weighted average of the targets according to the distance between their observations and the input observation.

* Add an optional parameter to the `KNeighborsRegressor` constructor called `weighted`. When `weighted=True` use the alternative algorithm, otherwise use the standard one. 
* Show that your code works by adding additional assertions.
* Compare this version of the algorithm to the standard version for the advertising data by modifying the code in `main_diy.py`. What are your findings? When and why might this algorithm be better than the standard algorithm?
