"The world‰Ûªs oil-producing countries are expected to raise prices $2 a barrel at the end of the summer, a move which could deepen the worldwide business recession and would add up to 8 cents to the gallon price of gasoline in the United States.</br></br>‰ÐÊ At the very least, many economists feel, a S2 increase 1 in world oil prices would post- * pone the time when an upswing in business might take place.</br></br>Some economists have long felt that the recession was triggered by the huge increase in world oil prices last year at the end of the Arab oil cm-1 bargo so that any new price j rise can only mean more trouble for. the world‰Ûªs economy. |</br></br>Federal Energy Administrator Frank G.

"The Treasury Department announced yesterday that it will be able to pay down $221 billion worth of the publicly held national debt this year without further curtailing its scheduled auctions of new Treasury securities.</br></br>Gary Gensler, Treasury undersecretary for domestic finance, told reporters that earlier cutbacks in the issuance of new securities and the department's planned buyback of $30 billion of older, high- yielding notes and bonds should allow the government to pay down the debt both this year and next.</br></br>But by 2002, when the amount of older securities coming due will begin to drop substantially, additional reductions in auctions will be needed, he indicated.</br></br>""At the present time, we do not believe further changes in the overall pattern of our coupon debt issuance are necessary,"" he said.</br></br>The price of the 30-year bond dropped on the news. It had climbed in recent trading because many economists and investors had expected the Treasury to say it will soon stop issuing the long bond, increasing the ""scarcity value"" of those remaining."
"HANOI--Vietnam's leaders are stepping up their campaign against critical blogs, ordering government investigators to arrest the operators of three websites at a time when global Internet companies are growing more worried about doing business in the tightly policed country.</br></br>A government statement issued late Wednesday named three blogs that allegedly posted articles accusing the government of corruption and human-rights abuses, describing the blogs as being part of a ""wicked plot of the hostile forces""--a term often used to describe advocates of democratic reforms.</br></br>Two of the three sites vowed to continue. One, Danlambao, or ""The People's Journalism Blog,"" said in a fresh posting Thursday that its anonymous operators are ""prepared to be repressed and imprisoned rather than leading the life of a dumb dog that dares not to bark,"" paving the way for a deepening confrontation between Vietnam's authoritarian leaders and its increasingly vibrant online community as the country's once-booming economy slumps.</br></br>The Web has taken off here faster than in many other up-and-coming nations. Around 34% of Vietnam's 90 million people are online, a larger proportion than in more established neighbors such as Thailand and Indonesia, driven in part by the rapid spread of high-speed cellphone networks and a desire among younger Vietnamese to connect with the rest of the world separately from the nation's state-run media.</br></br>Growing numbers of Vietnamese have launched their own blogs in recent months, where they discuss everything from traditional folk songs and where to buy secondhand iPhones to the corruption that has accompanied a decadelong economic expansion here. One prominent blogger, 60-year-old retired soldier Ng Thuong Thuy, writes forcefully under his own name about injustices in Vietnam's legal systems, especially the explosive issue of land rights which government-controlled media rarely cover."
"SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Burned by the dot-com blowout and costly growth investments, Web-hosting concern Exodus Communications Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection, but said its business will continue to operate.</br></br>Exodus, a Santa Clara, Calif., provider of services to major sites including Yahoo and eBay, has warned for months that it was quickly running out of cash and needed additional financing to stay afloat.</br></br>In addition to the Chapter 11 filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., Exodus said it received a commitment for up to $200 million in debtor-in-possession financing from General Electric Co.'s GE Capital.</br></br>""We will now be able to devote efforts to solidifying and executing on a go-forward operating plan that is based on tough-minded fiscal discipline and focuses on managing Exodus to profitability,"" said L.

"Although there are growing indications that the recession is easing, a new report on bank loan delinquencies suggests that many American households are still having trouble managing their debts.</br></br>The study by the American Bankers Association showed that more borrowers fell behind on their consumer loan payments during the first three months of the year.</br></br>The slippage was apparent in a wide range of debt, including car loans, personal loans and credit cards.</br></br>Overall, the delinquency rates were highest in the hard-hit Northeast. New Hampshire, where 5.61 percent of all consumer loans were delinquent, was worst off, followed by Massachusetts with 5.38 percent and New York with 4.15 percent.</br></br>In Arizona, by contrast, only 1.25 percent of loans were behind, with Nebraska, Colorado and New Mexico all under 1.5 percent."
"REPUBLICANS may have won significant victories across the country in Tuesday's elections, but California voters registered a strong dissent with Bush-administration policy by approving vastly expanded state funding for medical research involving embryonic stem cells.</br></br>The passage of California's Proposition 71, supported by nearly 60% of the state's voters, appears likely to herald a new era in U.S. stem-cell research. Restrictions on federal funding of the work have led to worries that the U.S. may be lagging behind in the nascent field of ""regenerative medicine,"" so called because of hopes that stem cells might be useful in treating conditions such as paralyzing spinal injuries, diabetes or Parkinson's disease.</br></br>Without question, Prop. 71 represents a financial windfall to embryonic stem-cell research. The measure, now enshrined in the California Constitution, sets aside $350 million a year for the work during the next decade or so, up to a total of $3 billion. That sum dwarfs the $25 million the federal National Institutes of Health allocated to embryonic stem-cell grants last year and is three times as much as what defeated Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry vowed to provide in federal funding.</br></br>Yet implementing the measure will raise a variety of new challenges, not least the question of whether the state can afford to devote so much money to basic research that might not yield medical or financial returns for a decade or more. During the past several years, California has consistently run the largest budget deficits in the nation, a fiscal gap it has temporarily plugged only by selling billions of dollars' of new bonds. Prop. 71, which will be funded by bond sales, could cost the state as much as $6 billion during the next 30 years.</br></br>It is unclear exactly how the new California Institute of Regenerative Medicine mandated by Prop. 71 will allocate the new research funds, and whether the state stands to benefit financially if the research leads to commercial medical therapies. While Prop. 71's approval may draw bright medical researchers and fresh biotechnology investment to California, it also may spur other states to pass similar measures in order to level the playing field."
"Wall Street emerged from the summer doldrums Wednesday as a second straight day of tame inflation data sent stocks sharply higher and pushed the Dow Jones industrial average to its highest level in three months. Falling crude futures, which slid below $72 per barrel, also fueled the gains.</br></br>The Dow rose 96.86, or 0.9 percent, to 11,327.12, its best close since May 16. The Dow has gone up nearly 229 points in two days. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 9.85, or 0.8 percent, to 1295.43, its highest level since May 11, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 34.53, or 1.6 percent, to 2149.54 for its best close since July 6.</br></br>The consumer price index, which measures price increases at the retail level, rose 0.4 percent in July, slightly higher than June's 0.2 percent increase. But with food and fuel prices removed, ""core"" CPI rose just 0.2 percent, less than the 0.3 percent economists expected.</br></br>Combined with Tuesday's producer price index, which showed a decline in core wholesale prices, the data point to a drop in inflation pressures. That would allow the Fed to stop raising rates, which would otherwise threaten economic growth and cramp corporate profits.</br></br>The housing market showed more signs of slowing, which could also motivate the Fed to maintain its position on rates. Housing starts fell to an annualized rate of 1.795 million in July, down from 1.85 million in June. The number of building permits issued likewise fell."
"NEW YORK -- Be cautious. Be smart.</br></br>This is the options market's advice to stock investors. With few people interested in adding to, or opening, positions, sentiment was slightly bearish, representing a shift from the previous week's listless mood when most traders watched everything from the safety of the sidelines.</br></br>""As traders say, 'It's a heavy market.' It's for sale,"" a specialist at the American Stock Exchange said.</br></br>The change in confidence was caused by a confluence of events including another sell-off in the technology and Internet sectors, an analysts' downgrade to sell from hold for bank stocks and lingering concerns about interest rates and inflation.</br></br>""No one's making money-long or short,"" the head of a major options-trading desk said."

Gordon said further controls would relieve the Federal Reserve as the ‰ÛÏonly bastion‰Û against inflation.</br></br>Primary news in the market today was a lower dollar again in Europe, the spending prime-rate increase, and, of course, anticipation of Phase IV.

"The AFL-CIO lashed out yesterday at the Democratic Congress and the President for refusing to run a big enough budget deficit to drive down the unemployment rate appreciably over the next two years.</br></br>The President has said a $60 billion deficit is all the country can tolerate next fiscal year without renewed inflation.

A $70 billion deficit will drive the rate down to only about 7.5 per cent by the end of next year, according to the House and Senate Budget committees.</br></br>The federation wants the rate reduced faster and further. It tried to persuade the Senate to raise its spending target another $9 billion in fiscal 1976, even at the cost of increasing the projected deficit. The $9 billion amendment failed, 64 to 29."
"NEW YORK -- Poor U.S. economic data continued to argue for an ultraloose U.S. monetary policy Thursday, weighing the dollar down against currencies with more appealing interest-rate outlooks.</br></br>""We believe the continued negative data that we are witnessing will push out Fed exit action well into 2012 and possibly 2013,"" said Douglas Borthwick, managing director of Faros Trading in Stamford, Conn.</br></br>The sour data even caused the dollar to give up all of its gains to the yen -- on the same day Japan released much worse-than-expected gross-domestic-product data stemming from the March earthquake and tsunami.</br></br>The divergence in currencies' interest-rate scenarios were illustrated in the comments of two central bankers.</br></br>Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans confirmed a loose monetary environment in the U.S. when he said higher food and energy prices aren't expected to translate into sustained inflationary pressure and that the bank should retain ""substantial"" monetary accommodation for some time. Meanwhile, European Central Bank Executive Board member Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell said the ECB must unwind its nonstandard monetary-policy measures as financial conditions improve, a signal for interest-rate increases down the road."
"Looks like there has been some international coordination of monetary policy rhetoric lately.</br></br>At the beginning of the week, the central bankers' central bank -- the Bank for International Settlements in Basel -- warned loudly of the risks of moving ""too slowly and too late"" to raise interest rates back toward normal. As it did before the global financial crisis, the BIS emphasized the need to act early to avoid the booms-and-busts in financial markets and offered all sorts of reasons why today's very low inflation shouldn't be the primary concern of central bankers.</br></br>Central bankers appear to have agreed on a common response.</br></br>In the past couple of days, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and Bank of England deputy governor Jon Cunliffe have used the same phrases to say: Fuggedaboutit!</br></br>With price and wage inflation not a concern right now, we aren't going to raise interest rates and throw at lot of people out of work to avoid excesses in financial markets or to head off possible asset bubbles, they said. There may come a day when our worries about financial stability will prompt us to hike interest rates, but rates are ""the last line of defense."" Not now. The ""first line of defense"" is making the financial system more resilient so it can better withstand shocks and using our supervisory and regulatory ""macroprudential tools"" to rein in excesses, as we are doing now."
"Nothing concentrates a man's mind quite like the prospect of being hanged in the morning, observed Samuel Johnson, the 18th century English writer. In a similar vein, two factors helped concentrate the minds of European governments in recent weeks as they thrashed out important details of the euro zone's proposed banking union.</br></br>The first was the European Parliament elections scheduled for May next year. These are expected to result in large gains for euro-skeptic and extremist parties, which could make it much harder to agree on complex legislation involving a substantial pooling of sovereignty.</br></br>The second is growing anxiety in the markets and among some policy makers that the euro zone is sliding into deflation. With interest rates already close to zero and no easy way to further loosen monetary policy, a credible banking union is the euro zone's best chance to reduce financial fragmentation and reduce borrowing costs in the periphery.</br></br>The result is that euro-zone leaders are expected this week to agree upon a far more substantial banking union deal than had recently seemed possible. This deal will include a legally binding set of arrangements for the winding up of failed banks--the so-called Single Resolution Mechanism--to be headed by a Single Resolution Board with access to a Single Resolution Fund to help pay for the cost of clearing up bank failures.</br></br>The speed with which the deal has fallen into place has surprised officials. Germany had previously ruled out any common euro-zone fund to help pay for winding up failed banks, insisting instead on a network of national funds."

"Friday's bullish report of 211,000 new jobs in March and a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.7% -- matching its lowest level in five years -- brings further evidence that the great American jobs machine rolls on. Since May of 2003, U.S. businesses have created 5.2 million new jobs. The highly publicized layoffs of 50,000 workers by Ford and General Motors over the next two years is the number of net new jobs the U.S. economy is producing every week in other industries.</br></br>In such high-growth regions as the Southeast and Mountain West, the problem is a shortage of willing and trained workers. Thank goodness for immigrant workers who are filling vital niches in the labor force. Critics continue to complain that President Bush's tax policies have only benefited the super-wealthy, but that would come as news to the five million Americans who were jobless before the 2003 tax cuts, and thus had no income, but now have a weekly paycheck.</br></br>Employers are on enough of a hiring spree that some Wall Street economists of the Keynesian persuasion are fretting over wage-push inflationary pressures. Inflationary pressures do exist due to a Federal Reserve policy of excess dollar liquidity, as evidenced by the $600 price of gold futures. But this is a problem for monetary policy. More people working increases the supply of goods and services, which forces prices down, not up.</br></br>Since at least February of 2004, wages have been rising at a slightly faster pace than core inflation, and the median wage has climbed to more than $600 a week for the first time ever. These pay hikes are a result of another hallmark of this expansion: rapid productivity growth, particularly in manufacturing. So workers are benefiting from a labor market trifecta: robust expansion in jobs, steady gains in productivity and gains in real take-home pay.</br></br>This employment boom once again stands in contrast to the jobs depression in France. Thanks to much more flexible work rules, ease of hiring and firing, lower government benefits for not working, and lower taxes on employers (29.6% of employer costs in the U.S. versus 47.4% in France), more than half of America's 15-to-24-year-olds have jobs, versus only about one-in-four in France."
"FedEx Flies Under the Radar on Fed Day</br></br>Investors seeking to take the global economy's temperature on Wednesday will be focusing intensely on the words and actions of the men and women at the Federal Reserve.</br></br>They would do well to look at FedEx Corp. as well as the Fed. The term ""bellwether"" is sorely overused, but it certainly applies to the world's largest airfreight company by volume.</br></br>Not only is trade a leading indicator of the global economy's health, but the high-value international airfreight that makes up much of FedEx's revenue is the leading tip of that leading indicator. Unfortunately for FedEx, the past year or so has been full of disappointing results and management guidance for that usually lucrative part of its business.</br></br>Between last May and today, expectations for its adjusted earnings per share in the fiscal year through May 2014 went from a predicted $8.56 to $6.97. Wednesday's results for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 are seen at a reported $1.46 versus $1.45 a year ago."
"JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Officials of the International Monetary Fund here and in Washington held out hope of defusing a high-profile confrontation with President Suharto over the wisdom of adopting a currency board in Indonesia.</br></br>IMF officials are now talking hopefully about an agreement in principle that would allow Mr. Suharto to save face by keeping the currency-board option alive but delaying implementation of it until banking-sector and debt issues can be addressed. That could take at least six months, a near-eternity in the current crisis.</br></br>A currency board would take over the role of the central bank in strengthening Indonesia's currency, which has lost 73% of its value since last summer. Under a board, an approach used in Argentina and Hong Kong, a government pledges to buy its currency at a fixed rate against a designated foreign currency, in this case the U.S. dollar, and to hold enough foreign reserves to back all its currency in circulation.</br></br>The IMF, the U.S. and other donor countries have argued strongly against a currency board for Indonesia, saying it would do more harm to the economy than good unless banking and other economic reforms were fully in place.</br></br>""It is important to show that the currency board is something we could work for together in the future,"" a senior IMF official here said Wednesday."
"EUROPE</br></br>Alitalia Forecasts</br></br>Sharp Rebound</br></br>As Sale Nears</br></br>As Italy moves closer to privatizing Alitalia, the nation's flag carrier is apparently making significant progress on several fronts. The airline yesterday announced that it expects its earnings to be up sharply for the full year and that it plans to invest 4.3 trillion lire ($2.6 billion) over the next few years to buy 23 jetliners and update its information technology. But the most impressive figures to potential future investors have got be what the carrier, which saw third-quarter sales jump 5% and is set to be privatized within months, is doing to improve its balance sheet. It has cut debt to 15% of capital in the first half, from 89% at the end of last year, and is continuing to trim its bloated payroll. The airline's stock is also benefiting from the fact that Italy and the U.S. recently struck a preliminary deal to boost the number of flights between the two countries and free ticket prices from government control."
"A downturn in consumer spending threw a new domestic worry into mounting global turmoil, threatening to again undercut hopes for a breakout performance in the U.S. economy.</br></br>Retail sales fell 0.3% in September, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. The broad-based decline came alongside weakening consumer confidence and minimal wage growth that has weighed on the recovery in recent years.</br></br>While spending at retailers is up 4.3% from a year earlier, double the pace of inflation, the September stumble continues a choppy pattern that shows many Americans are cautious heading into the holiday shopping season.</br></br>""We're still trudging along, but not at the accelerating pace that we'd like to see,"" said Moody's Analytics economist Scott Hoyt. The data don't change expectations for modest U.S. growth in gross domestic product, ""but it's a cautionary note.""</br></br>September's reading also could be reversed or revised next month. A slowdown from strong summer auto sales, falling gasoline prices and the timing of Apple Inc.'s iPhone 6 release all played a role in the latest data. Earlier concerns of a consumer slowdown in July were eased when sales for that month were revised up to a respectable 0.3% gain from an initial flat reading."

"HONG KONG -- China's foreign-exchange reserves ballooned to $818.9 billion at the end of last year, putting the country on the road to hitting the $1 trillion mark and claiming the world's largest reserves this year. The expanding coffers will likely add to pressure from the U.S. for Beijing to speed up appreciation of its currency.</br></br>For China, the reserves are in some ways an embarrassment of riches. They draw unwelcome attention to Beijing's policy of maintaining exchange-rate stability by buying up most of the dollars that flood into the country in the form of foreign direct investment, export earnings and speculative capital. Critics in the U.S. and Europe complain that this practice gives Chinese exporters an unfair advantage on world markets by making the Chinese yuan artificially cheap.</br></br>Partly in response to U.S. pressure, Beijing allowed a 2.1% appreciation of the yuan against the dollar last July and pledged to make its exchange rate more market-driven. However, since that time, the yuan has edged up only by a further 0.52%. It last traded on Friday at 8.0698 to the dollar.</br></br>Coupled with other evidence of breakneck economic growth in China, the buildup of reserves ""is definitely helping Western countries to add pressure on China"" for currency appreciation, said Grace Ng, a senior economist at J.P. Morgan.</br></br>To China's critics, the figures provide evidence that the economy can withstand a stronger currency. If, as expected, the country's reserves leap by a similar margin this year, taking the total over the $1 trillion threshold, economists say Beijing will find it harder to resist pressure for faster currency appreciation from the U.S. and other major trading partners and still avoid a protectionist backlash."

"Continuing Germany's piecemeal retreat from high interest rates, the Bundesbank today lowered its key discount rate by a half point, triggering similar cuts in several other European nations.</br></br>There was disappointment at the small size of the cut to 7.5 percent from 8 percent and the fact that Germany's central bank also did not reduce the Lombard emergency financing rate, which remains at 9 percent.</br></br>One analyst said the cut was too small to have a significant impact on the economy of European countries.</br></br>""There must be more steps taken,"" said Dietmar Viertel, an analyst with the Duesseldorf firm of Trinkhaus and Burkhardt.</br></br>The fact that the Bundesbank made any cut at all is seen as an indication that board members were encouraged by a pact signed last weekend between the German government and opposition parties agreeing to a package of taxes and cost-cutting measures aimed at paying for unification."

But the bar is high, and some makers aren't yet convinced of the quality of Chinese denim.</br></br>What has given Japanese denim its cachet is a combination of sophisticated washes and high-quality yarns that absorb color more evenly and look antiqued. Expensive labels from Kasil to 7 For All Mankind often tout the fact that they use Japanese denim.</br></br>Now, however, Chinese factories are starting to churn out denim with a similar appearance and texture -- for about half the price. Japanese denim generally runs $5 to $12 a yard, depending on the finish, while Chinese denim is $2.50 to $3.50.</br></br>For some companies, Chinese denim provides a way to move up the denim hierarchy. Next week, Eddie Bauer, which mostly produced $50 jeans made with basic U.S. denim, will also start selling ""premium"" trouser jeans, trench coats and skirts made of Chinese denim and priced between $68 and $98. On the high end, makers like Joie and Odyn are planning to use the less-expensive Chinese fabric for jeans with more costly hand-distressing or embellishment that will retail for about the same price as plainer styles in Japanese denim."
"The old dragon of inflation -- thought to have been slain -- may be lurking.</br></br>Many economists, including those at the Federal Reserve, aren't worried -- yet. But there have been confusing warning signs in recent weeks. Core inflation, the prices consumers pay for goods and services, excluding food and energy, increased 0.5% in both January and February. Hourly earnings jumped 0.5% in March and are running at a 4% annual rate of increase for the first three months of the year.</br></br>It's a fluke, say Federal Reserve officials, who believe that the economy is too soft to support a round of big price increases. But that view may be rattled tomorrow and Friday, when the Labor Department releases new data on movement on the producer price and consumer price indexes in March. If the numbers show another solid increase in prices, it could incite much more serious worries about inflation.</br></br>Low inflation has been one of the bittersweet benefits of this unusually sluggish recovery. Demand hasn't been strong enough to allow retailers and producers to up the prices of goods. And a weak labor market has kept wages relatively subdued. As a result, consumer prices edged up their smallest amount in six years during 1992.</br></br>But now that the economy is showing signs of firming, some businesses are trying to push through price increases, hoping the market will finally bear it. ""Industry sectors are trying to recoup what they gave up in the depth of the downturn,"" said Mark Steinkrauss, vice president of investor relations for Fruit of the Loom Inc. The company raised prices 5% on a line of T-shirts at the start of the year."
"NEW YORK -- Amid signs that the Federal Reserve is near the end of its aggressive rate-cutting campaign, the bond market appears at a turning point.</br></br>Investors widely expect Fed policy makers, who meet again tomorrow, to cut interest rates once more. But what happens after that is less clear.</br></br>Many in the market believe any rate reduction tomorrow could be the last the Fed makes in this interest-rate cycle. They cite evidence that consumer sentiment, wages, retail sales and the equities markets either remain fairly strong or are recovering from weakness last winter.</br></br>The implications are crucial to the Treasurys market, which staged a yearlong rally as the economy and the stock market began to languish and as the Fed cut short-term interest rates by two percentage points in the first four months of this year.</br></br>If interest rates are near their lows of this cycle, and if the economy finally is stirring in response to the Fed's strong medicine, the outlook for Treasurys is considerably less bright, analysts note."
"Growth prospects for major economies are divergent in the months ahead, according to a think tank's data, causing a headache for policy makers and volatility in financial markets.</br></br>Economic growth in the U.S. and Japan is set to pick up, while Russia and Brazil appear set for slowdowns, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's composite leading indicators for May.</br></br>Released Monday, the indicators underlined the multispeed nature of the global economic recovery, with Germany expected to lead a modest revival in the euro zone, while growth in France is set to remain weak.</br></br>Among large developing economies, China is set to grow at around its long-term trend rate, while the outlook for India is uncertain.</br></br>""Composite leading indicators...point to diverging growth patterns in major economies,"" the OECD said."
"They bought like crazy. They sold like crazy. And for a tense 15 minutes leading up to the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate cut, investors froze. Then they bought again, sold off again and called it a day.</br></br>""I can't take the stress anymore,"" barked Bob Basel, chief trader at Salomon Smith Barney, after the Dow Jones industrial average rode a roller coaster to an 8986.28 close -- down 24.97 points, or 0.3 percent.</br></br>The average of 30 blue-chip firms had been frozen -- down about 60 points -- until shortly after 2:15 p.m., when the Fed announcement came. ""There was this sort of jump ball as to whether the rate cut would come or not,"" said Ed McMahon, head of U.S. trading for Merrill Lynch.</br></br>The Fed said it would cut two key interest rates -- and within 15 minutes the Dow jumped nearly 100 points, but it then bobbed up and down for the remainder of the afternoon. Day traders seeking a quick profit were out in full force, traders said, and some large computerized sell-offs kicked in during the final minutes of trading, plunging the Dow into negative territory.</br></br>""The cut was significant because it confirms that the Fed is prepared to do whatever it has to do to maintain liquidity and keep the market's momentum going,"" said Mary Farrell, an equity strategist at Paine Webber. ""They have restored rationality in the market."""
"If there is to be no peace dividend, as Defense Secretary Richard Cheney keeps telling us, why not? If the Pentagon budgets are being cut, as Cheney also keeps telling us, where is the money going? Somebody must be pulling our leg.</br></br>The first lesson to be drawn from the apparent contradiction between Cheney's promise of a big reduction in defense spending and the prospect of no peace dividend, is this: Cheney isn't really offering a major cut in defense spending. On the contrary, he is proposing only to keep defense spending from rising as rapidly in the next five years as it otherwise would have. Moreover, the average Pentagon spending level in the five-year period, 1996-2000, would jump to $365 billion annually from an average of $304 billion in 1991-95. Hence, no apparent defense cut, no apparent peace dividend.</br></br>But if defense spending were to be reduced enough to reflect political reality-namely, that the West is in less danger of attack from the Soviet Union than it was before-there must be a peace dividend.</br></br>It would be one thing if Cheney were to say that some part of the peace dividend has already been spoken for: the savings-and-loan debacle alone will chew up $200 billion in the decade of the '90s that could have been better spent elsewhere. And the probability is that taxpayers will have to fork over billions to make good on some other government-insured or -sponsored programs. But those unfortunate costs would be there even if there had been no dramatic prodemocracy developments within Eastern Europe and a better understanding with the Soviet Union.</br></br>The problem is how to assess all of the bills facing the nation in changed circumstances, and to determine how to allocate our total resources. And the first task is to cut through all of the gobbledygook of Cheney's numbers. He projected a ""$180 billion reduction"" in defense spending over five years. That, first of all, refers to budget authority, not outlays, which would be down $120 billion. But that is a bit of fantasy-a cut from earlier, projected levels of expenditures that have not yet been reached, not from current levels."
"Depressed consumer spending and the global credit crisis created a double-edged sword that drove more than 5,000 businesses into bankruptcy last month, marking a 25% increase since the start of the year.</br></br>The 5,233 new commercial bankruptcy filings in May also represented a 46% increase from May 2007, according to data from Automated Access to Court Electronic Records, or AACER. The filings include businesses seeking to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code as well as companies that are liquidating their assets under Chapter 7.</br></br>""The increase is driven by the credit crisis, which started shortly after May 2007,"" said Stephen J. Lubben, a bankruptcy-law professor at Seton Hall University in Newark, N.J. ""Last summer, credit began tightening and it's remained tight ever since, so firms are not able to refinance their way out of trouble anymore.""</br></br>More than 8,700 businesses filed for bankruptcy during the first quarter of 2008, according to new federal court data released Tuesday. The 8,713 new filings represented an increase of nearly 39% from the 6,280 companies that filed in the first three months in 2007, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts said.</br></br>Among the more than 5,000 businesses that sought bankruptcy protection last month were home-products retailer Linens 'n Things Inc. and restaurant chain Steakhouse Partners Inc., which joined an expanding list of distressed businesses such as electronic-gadget seller Sharper Image Corp. that depend on consumer spending."
"The U.S. economy is ending the year with a flurry of good news, including signs that inflation has receded, consumers are spending money briskly and growth is likely to continue well into 2007.</br></br>""Here comes Santa Claus!"" Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wachovia, wrote to clients after a new batch of favorable statistics was released yesterday. ""All we wanted this holiday season was a little more growth and a little less inflation. Boy oh boy, has Santa delivered.""</br></br>Nearly gone is the inflation scare of the spring and summer, as are investors' doubts about whether a new Federal Reserve chairman would be tough enough to beat back price increases. And almost gone are analysts' worries that the slumping housing market would curb consumer spending and trigger a recession.</br></br>On the contrary, Wall Street loosened the corks in the champagne bottles all week as each unexpectedly rosy economic figure rolled in.</br></br>Inflation, for the moment, is at 0 percent: The consumer price index was unchanged in November, as falling fuel prices and discounts on such items as clothing, electronics, airfares and hotel rooms offset increased prices for many other goods and services, the Labor Department said yesterday."
"The abiding cliche about Gerald Ford -- who died Tuesday at age 93 -- is that he was a decent man who steadied the country but held the White House too briefly to leave a major imprint. We've always thought that view of his Presidency is too diminishing, not least because he led the nation at a dangerous time and resisted political furies that could have done the U.S. far more harm.</br></br>""America's Suicide Attempt"" is how the historian Paul Johnson describes the 1970s. And it is important to recall the bad temper of the times that Ford inherited in becoming the 38th President. He succeeded Richard Nixon, who had resigned over the Watergate coverup and amid an unpopular war in Vietnam. He faced large liberal majorities in Congress that were emboldened by their ouster of Nixon and set to revive the Great Society. And he had to clean up the financial problems caused by a burst of inflation and wage and price controls. Ford navigated all of these traumas better than he gets credit for.</br></br>---</br></br>It is true that Ford was something of an accidental President, the only one in U.S. history never elected as either President or Vice President. Before Nixon picked him to replace the disgraced Spiro Agnew as his Vice President, Ford had been contemplating retirement from his Grand Rapids, Michigan, House seat. But like another unlikely President from the Midwest, Harry Truman, he had reserves of honesty and fortitude that served him well.</br></br>He made a particular contribution in pardoning Nixon, though he knew Nixon's enemies would accuse him of a quid pro quo. The decision cost him dearly in the polls and may have cost him the election in 1976, but it also spared the country from years of division over a criminal trial that special prosecutor Leon Jaworski seemed determined to pursue."
"It's hard to decide when the market has peaked and it's time to get out. It may be even harder to know when the damage is over and it's time to get back in.</br></br>But pulling off both in succession is exceedingly rare.</br></br>This would be important to keep in mind at any time, but especially right now as the bull market that began in March 2009 is entering its 54th month.</br></br>Since peaking on July 24, the broad stock market -- as measured by the Wilshire 5000 index -- has fallen 2.7%. Even if the market has topped out and you sidestep a decline by getting out of stocks now, the odds of long-term success still are against you.</br></br>Trying to time the market is by and large a losing proposition, even for the pros."

"OPEC‰ÛªS MEETINGS have become a kind of theater in which the world can see the political conflicts being played out among the oil-exporting countries. The war between Iran and Iraq has severely damaged the cartel‰Ûªs ability to set prices, for every issue and every meeting lead back to that central division. For some of these countries, far more than the price of oil is'at stake*in these meetings. To most of OPEC‰Ûªs members oil simply means a higher standard of living. But for those in the Persian Gulf, oil and the wealth it generates are their only means of self-protection and survival.</br></br>In the meeting just ended the key was, as usual, Saudi Arabia. The Saudi attitude toward the Iranians and their perennial demands for higher prices varies over time. It depends on developments in the war and the degree of support and reassurance provided by the United States. Late last year, after the gains by Iran in the war and the revelations that the United States had been covertly sending arms to the Iranians, the Saudis moved quickly to accommodate Iran. That enabled OPEC to raise prices and stabilize them.</br></br>But since then the land war has apparently deadlocked, with no recent Iranian gains of significance, and the Gulf has filled with ships of the</br></br>Western navies conspicuously including the United States‰Ûª. With that, the Saudis have become markedly less inclined to assist Iran. To the contrary, they are deliberately diminishing the flow of revenues on which Iran depends for arms to keep fighting.</br></br>But Iran is apparently doing quite an effective job of casting it as a quarrel between the rich and the poor, with themselves as the revolutionary spokesman of the poorest. The present quotas assign to Saudi Arabia, with its small population, one-fourth of all OPEC‰Ûªs oil income, a point that does not pass unnoticed among the Africans and the Indonesians. Iran was able to argue that it was trying to protect the real price of oil against inflation and the falling American dollar. Instead, the Saudis and their allies have pushed the price lower."

"NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve's abrupt credit easing and the dollar's sharp fall will help avert a recession next year, according to many economists and investment managers. But they also predict that inflation and interest rates will rebound next year.</br></br>Since the Oct. 19 stock market crash, interest rates have tumbled more than 1 1/2 percentage points as the Federal Reserve suddenly opened the monetary spigot in an effort to calm the financial markets. Last week, the Reagan administration emphasized that its top priority is to prevent a recession, even if that means a lower dollar.</br></br>These policies may only provide ""a respite"" for the credit markets, says John Paulus, a managing director at Morgan Stanley & Co.

"It's no coincidence that check-cashing businesses locate in poor and working-class neighborhoods. These operations, which usually move in as commercial banks move out, can be found in pawn shops, liquor stores or their own storefronts.</br></br>But no matter where they are found, check-cashing businesses have two things in common: They are unregulated by the state, and they fleece the poor. For a substantial fee, these enterprises will cash a paycheck, sell a money order or facilitate the payment of utility or other bills. However, their real pay dirt comes with the payday loan.</br></br>The payday loan, already banned in New Jersey and New York, is a process by which people can borrow against their next paycheck at interest rates nearly 20 times the state's 33 percent interest rate cap. For example, a person who wants to borrow $300 on his next paycheck writes a postdated check for $379. The check casher holds the check until the borrower's next payday. For another $79 fee, the loan can be rolled over for two more weeks. Calculated on an annual basis, the $79 comes to an interest rate of 600 percent.</br></br>Legislation will be introduced during the next Maryland legislative session to impose state regulation on the check-cashing industry. Another bill will be introduced to prohibit payday loans.</br></br>Of course, the industry claims these cash advances are not loans at all but ""deferred deposits."" But several states, including Virginia, have won court cases that found that ""deferred deposits"" were indeed loans and that the interest charged was in excess of the interest caps mandated by those states."
"BONN. Jan. 11‰ÛÓWest Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, today renewed its fight to arrest this country‰Ûªs mounting inflation by raising Its discount rate from 4.5 to 5 cent.</br></br>The action was announced in Frankfurt by the bank‰Ûªs vice president, Otmar Em-minger, following the first meeting of directors in the new year. It marked the fourth time in three months that the bank has boosted the rate by half a percentage point.</br></br>At the same time, the bank raised the so-called Lombard rate, which is applied on loans against capital, from 6.5 to 7 per cent. Both new rates will go into effect Friday.</br></br>As an additional measure, the bank announced a 10 per cent reduction in its rediscount ciuota to go into effect on April 1. The rediscount quota is the amount of money that banks can borrow from the Bundesbank at t lie discount rate instead of the Lombard rate, with its higher interest charges.</br></br>This lowering of the rediscount quota will be in addition to another 10 per cent reduction, announced last month and scheduled to go into effect on Feb. 1."

"Many people have wondered lately what happened to the American Dream. Somehow, in the face of tougher foreign competition, a wary Wall Street and skittish customers, that fabled chance to turn a clever idea into a caravan of cash seemed to slip away.</br></br>Len Bosack and Sandy Lerner are proof that the dream-and this sunny region of Northern California that thrives on it most-are alive and well.</br></br>Just a few years ago, the husband-and-wife team was developing computer equipment in a bedroom of their home, assembling it in the living room and holding meetings with their nine-person staff in the cramped dining room. Lacking a sales force, they peddled their goods over electronic computer networks. Lacking a service department, they took customer calls at 2 a.m. on a phone conveniently positioned by their bed.</br></br>Today, their company, Cisco Systems Inc., is fast filling a spacious industrial building south of San Francisco and is shipping $70 million a year worth of sophisticated equipment used to link clusters of computers at scattered locations. Modestly paid employees of Stanford University until starting Cisco, the young couple now have a net worth in Cisco's publicly traded shares of $80 million.</br></br>Bosack and Lerner are doing much to strengthen the ethic of risk-taking that has made this area the world's leading hothouse for innovation. Even as the technology-rich Northeast flirts with recession and as defense cutbacks cloud Southern California's future, Silicon Valley is enjoying a bit of a resurgence. Fed by the recent hunger on Wall Street for new stock offerings, young technology companies like Cisco are stirring up an enthusiasm that is unmatched since 1983, when nearly three dozen Silicon Valley companies went public in a frenzy of first-time stock offerings."
"The Canadian dollar was mostly unchanged against the U.S. dollar after a mixed round of economic data in the U.S. and Canada.</br></br>The U.S. dollar was at C$1.0154 Thursday morning, from C$1.0159 right before the data and C$1.0161 late Wednesday, according to data provider CQG.</br></br>Canada's economy grew at a 0.2% rate in January, slightly ahead of expectations of a tepid 0.1% pace. The U.S. economy, meanwhile, advanced at a 0.4% annual rate between October and December, revised upward from last month's reading of 0.1% growth.</br></br>The Canadian dollar, which initially edged higher right after the release of the data, returned swiftly to its previous levels shortly afterward. The loonie's brief gains were tempered by a weaker reading of U.S. jobless claims which increased by 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 357,000 in the week ended March 23. It was the second week in a row that saw an increase in jobless claims, a possible sign that the U.S.'s labor market may have lost a bit of momentum.</br></br>The Canadian dollar was largely flat in overnight trading, despite a 2.8% fall in China's equity market, a soft German unemployment report and the re-opening of banks in Cyprus, albeit with substantial capital controls in place."
"Leading Democrats launched a series of stinging attacks on President Bush here today, challenging his handling of the economy, response to corporate accountability scandals and conduct of the war on terrorism while charging there is a ""leadership deficit"" in Washington that they are prepared to fill.</br></br>The across-the-board critique, including pointed questions about the war in Afghanistan, reflected a growing belief among Democrats that voter anxiety over the economy makes the president and the Republican Party more vulnerable than at any time since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.</br></br>Chiding Republicans for trying to pin the economy's current problems on the ""binge"" days of the 1990s, Sen.

""When it comes to fiscal responsibility and economic growth, this administration is all blame and no game plan, all response and no responsibility,"" she said at the summer meeting of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council (DLC).</br></br>Democrats sought to place the blame on Bush and his big tax cut for a return to federal budget deficits and a downturn in the economy, claiming that he is presiding over a ""jobless recovery"" and stock market volatility that has left many Americans worried about their retirement security.</br></br>""The economy is in trouble and there is no economic leadership coming from the White House today,"" Senate Majority Leader Thomas A.

"The U.S. dollar eased against most major foreign currencies yesterday in response to a slight decline in U.S. interest rates. But the currency held on to most of the gains made Wednesday against the Japanese yen, which weakened on indications that Tokyo wants to lower interest rates in an effort to spur the country's economy.</br></br>Lower Japanese interest rates would make yen-denominated investments less attractive.</br></br>The Reagan administration is taking a wait-and-see attitude toward recent hints that Japan may be about to slacken its efforts to bolster the yen against the U.S. dollar.</br></br>Although officials in Washington declined to comment publicly, top U.S. planners were said to be split over the apparent change in Japan's currency strategy.</br></br>The administration doesn't want Tokyo to allow any significant slippage in the yen's recent rise against the dollar."
"Opponents of education vouchers like to say they prefer ""public school choice"" known as charters. But even that claim often turns out to be an illusion under pressure from teachers unions. Consider what's happening in Connecticut, where Republican Governor M. Jodi Rell is resisting charter expansion despite their notable success in the state.</br></br>Charter schools -- which are free from many of the union work-rule constraints imposed on regular public schools -- have been allowed in Connecticut since 1997, and there are now 14 of them. A study by Western Michigan University found that the state's charter students ""are gaining more on the state assessment tests than students in surrounding traditional public schools.""</br></br>If charter middle schools were treated as a single school district, it would lead the state among districts with more than 25% black and Hispanic enrollment. Another WMU study conducted three years ago found similar results, and the authors note that, of the six states they're monitoring, ""the results from Connecticut are the most positive and promising for charter schools that we have seen.""</br></br>Alas, Connecticut is also one of only two states -- the other is New Jersey -- that artificially cap charter enrollment (at 300 students per school), and thus its schools have an average waiting list of 200 students. Reformers want to expand the number of charter schools, as well as remove the enrollment limit; make charters eligible for the state's school construction program; and raise charter spending by a modest $10 million to bring them in line with what the state spends on other public schools.</br></br>Connecticut currently spends on average about $9,100 per student in regular public schools, though that figure can run to $13,000 in urban districts such as New Haven and Hartford. Teacher salaries are among the highest in the country. By contrast, under current law the state allots charters just $7,250 per student, even though most charters operate in urban districts and, unlike regular public schools, must also cover their own facility costs."
"WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials agreed at last month's policy meeting that more interest-rate increases might be needed to combat inflation, but given increased uncertainties about the economy, they opted not to cite higher rates as their only alternative.</br></br>""[I]n light of the increased uncertainty about the outlook for both growth and inflation, the [Federal Open Market Committee] also agreed that the statement should no longer cite only the possibility of further firming,"" according to a summary of the March 20-21 meeting, released yesterday with the usual three-week lag.</br></br>Downside economic-growth risks ""had increased in the weeks since the January [FOMC] meeting,"" according to the minutes, ""and the latest information cast some doubt on whether core inflation was on the expected downward path.""</br></br>The Fed has held the federal-funds interest rate steady at 5.25% since June. At last month's meeting, it dropped a longstanding reference to the possibility of higher interest rates, saying instead that ""future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth.""</br></br>Investors' initial reaction that the wording meant the Fed might cut rates was quickly reversed a week after the Fed meeting when Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said, ""I do want to emphasize that we have not shifted away from an inflation bias."""

"WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve policy makers raised interest rates last month in part because markets expected them to do so, and they figured failure to act might hurt their credibility as inflation fighters, minutes of the meeting suggest.</br></br>The minutes were released on the second of two days of congressional testimony on monetary policy by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. Mr. Bernanke repeated his main themes of the previous day: Inflation is at a troubling level but should decline as the economy slows and energy prices stabilize.</br></br>Yesterday, markets lowered to 47%, from 62% Wednesday, the odds the Fed would raise short-term interest rates, now at 5.25%, to 5.5% at its next meeting Aug. 8.</br></br>Policy makers boosted their target for short-term rates in June because of a ""deterioration in the inflation outlook,"" the minutes say. But they also acted to ""preserve the decline in inflation expectations"" of preceding weeks, which ""appeared to be conditioned"" on expectations of higher rates.</br></br>Fed officials typically attribute rate actions to economic and inflation developments, not to market expectations. The disclosure in the minutes, released after the customary three-week delay, suggests that based on their economic forecast alone, the decision to raise rates would have been a closer call."

"Fannie Mae has had to restate earnings covering the past several years, but the company's economist got his numbers right for this survey. Mr. Berson accurately predicted that the nation's gross domestic product -- the most widely used barometer of economic growth -- would be above the consensus expectation of 3.5% growth in the first quarter of 2005. His forecast was 3.9%; the government reported Wednesday that the actual figure was 3.8%. Mr. Berson also nailed his forecast for the change in the consumer-price index, which advanced 2.8% for the 12 months through May.</br></br>Strong growth and inklings of inflation would normally lead to much higher yields on long-term Treasurys. But it didn't in the first half, and that is what really set Mr. Berson apart from other forecasters. The panel got walloped -- yet again -- by the bond market. The consensus among economists was that 10-year Treasury yields would rise from 4.2% in December to 4.8% by the end of June. But yields declined instead to 3.9%. Mr. Berson said they would rise to only 4.45%, making him less wrong than just about everyone else.</br></br>Mr. Berson, who has worked at Fannie Mae for 17 years, is a baseball fanatic whose favorite number-cruncher is Bill James, a cult hero among baseball fans for his statistical abstracts of the nation's pastime. Mr. Berson said he will keep his first-half home run in perspective. ""I'm constantly humbled by bad forecasts in both baseball and economics,"" he said.</br></br>Right behind Mr. Berson was Lawrence Kudlow, the popular CNBC-TV commentator and head of the economic-consulting firm Kudlow & Co. He correctly predicted strong growth and a firmer dollar. Rounding out the top five were Mickey Levy of Bank of America Corp., Robert DiClemente of Citigroup Inc. and David Littmann, who retired from Comerica Inc. -- and our survey -- earlier this year.</br></br>The least-accurate forecasts came from James Smith, a University of North Carolina business-school professor who predicted that falling oil prices would push the consumer-price index into negative territory; Bob Shrouds and Robert Fry, DuPont Co. economists who forecast a sharp economic slowdown; and Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, Ford Motor Co.'s chief economist, who predicted weaker growth and rising bond yields. Ironically, another person near the bottom -- David Rosenberg at Merrill Lynch & Co. -- had the best forecast for Treasurys. He said bond yields would drop to 3.8%. But Mr. Rosenberg, one of the more bearish economists on Wall Street, missed the boat by predicting weak growth and much tamer inflation."
"As financial markets went haywire this month, Wall Street looked to one of its own, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., for help.</br></br>Paulson, who was chairman of the investment bank Goldman Sachs before joining the Bush administration, has acknowledged that the downturn in the markets could damage the U.S. economy. But the Treasury Department under Paulson has made no dramatic public moves to shore up frozen markets for home mortgages and other debt.</br></br>Yesterday, Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke met with Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) as the debate over the government's response to the breakdown of markets for mortgage and other debt moved to Capitol Hill.</br></br>Dodd, in a news conference after the private meeting, called on Paulson and Bernanke to ""use all the tools at their disposal"" to ease the problems. Most of the policy changes Dodd suggested would do little to affect frozen credit markets in the near term, economists said, but rather might help prevent a similar event.</br></br>The reality is that, for Paulson and the Treasury Department, there are relatively few tools that would allow this or any administration to manage the ups and downs of financial markets, according to economists and economic policymakers of both parties."

The March 8 jobs report jolted the markets, as investors lost hopes for further interest rate cuts and some worried that the Fed might even raise rates.</br></br>Mr. Greenspan said that while some uncertainties remain, ""recent data have confirmed the expectation that a good bit of the economic sluggishness of late 1995 was related to inventory adjustment,"" as companies struggled to pare stockpiles of unsold goods. ""The current economic expansion seems to have exhibited staying power,"" despite the drag from January's severe weather, the brief government shutdown and the recent General Motors Corp. strike, he said.</br></br>He also said high consumer-debt levels and other factors still might be restraining spending. But ""the recent data seem to indicate that those restraining influences are not so strong as to seriously jeopardize the continued expansion of the economy,"" Mr. Greenspan said.</br></br>Economic growth, he said, should continue without fueling inflation. The latest reports of continued low inflation, he said, are ""reasonably encouraging,"" pronouncing himself pleased but ""never satisfied."""

"Corn prices rose Monday after the U.S. Department of Agriculture cut its forecast for the size of this fall's crop, though the harvest would still be the nation's largest ever.</br></br>Corn futures climbed 1.3% after the government said the corn crop will total 13.8 billion bushels. That is down 1.3% from the USDA's estimate last month but would easily break the record of 13.1 billion bushels set in 2009.</br></br>The government trimmed its production estimate because it expects lower yields than it had projected last month. The USDA didn't explain why but noted that its yield estimate was the first of the season based on surveys of farmers and field inspections. It trimmed projected yields to 154.4 bushels an acre, from 156.5 last month.</br></br>The report surprised analysts, who largely expected that favorable weather this summer would lead the USDA to increase its production forecast.</br></br>""Not many people were expecting the corn yield to be cut,"" said Jim Gerlach, president of A/C Trading Co., a Fowler, Ind., commodities brokerage. Analysts on average were looking for a yield of about 157.7 bushels an acre."
"Ellen Scott is a senior human-resources representative at Rockwell International Corp.'s Rocketdyne division. She is young -- 27 years old -- and successful.</br></br>Ms. Scott is also part of a fast-growing group in corporate America: black professional women. Between 1982 and 1992, this group grew a heady 125%. Black female professionals in the 38,000 companies that report to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission now number almost 200,000.</br></br>This is, of course, minuscule compared with the number of white professionals -- male and female. But it is nearly twice the number of black male professionals. According to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal of EEOC data, there were 1.2 black female professionals for every black male professional in 1982. Now, there are 1.8. Though white women have made substantial gains relative to white men, white men continue to have a greater share of professional jobs: In 1982 there were 0.62 white women professionals for every white man; in 1992, there were 0.94.</br></br>Black women also are making strides in the more general category of ""white collar, excluding clerical."" In 1982, there were slightly more black women than black men in that category. By 1992, the number of black women in those jobs had grown 90% to about 815,000, while the number of men had grown less than 50%, to about 564,000.</br></br>That black women are rising more rapidly than black men in corporate America is a source of mixed feelings for blacks. Considering the obstacles to promotion that minorities of all kinds often face, the success of black women professionals is reason for pride."

"WASHINGTON-- U.S. consumer prices ticked up in May as weak growth abroad and slow wage gains at home kept inflation pressures contained.</br></br>rose a seasonally adjusted 0.1% last month, the Labor Department said Tuesday, driven by higher rents, airfares and energy costs.</br></br>While the data suggest prices are stabilizing after two months of declines, even with May's small gain, consumer prices are up only 1.4% from a year earlier. The latest report showed that four years into the economic recovery, demand still remains too weak for firms to push prices higher and unemployment too high for workers to secure significantly higher wages.</br></br>""The economy is still running well below capacity and for that reason you're going to see inflation run on the soft side,"" said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan Chase.</br></br>The moderate inflation readings should give the Federal Reserve latitude to proceed cautiously in reining in its bond-buying program in the coming months. Fed officials started a two-day meeting Tuesday where they're expected to discuss how to adjust their $85 billion-a-month in bond purchases. The purchases, coupled with near-zero interest rates, are designed to spur economic growth and boost job creation."

"WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the U.S. will emphasize the urgency of reviving the global economy at next week's summit in Tokyo, and predicted that Germany will cut interest rates again to that end.</br></br>""You've seen . . . the consensus across Europe that rates should be lowered. Frankly, I think they'll be lowered some more,"" Mr. Bentsen said in an interview. The German Bundesbank's policy makers meet today, but Mr. Bentsen wouldn't say if he expects an interest-rate cut that soon.

"WASHINGTON -- Consumer credit in July continued to grow at a rapid rate, although the pace was slower than in the previous two months, the Federal Reserve Board said.</br></br>Consumer credit increased a seasonally adjusted $7.11 billion in July, the board said, after rising $7.83 billion in June and a record $10.23 billion in May.</br></br>Alan Murray, vice president of Citicorp Information Services, said the July figures show that ""consumer demand remains strong,"" despite other signs that the vigorous economic recovery may be slowing. He said the continued heavy borrowing suggests that consumer spending isn't about to decline precipitously, as some consumer-goods producers had feared.</br></br>Still, Mr. Murray doesn't expect such unusually strong growth in consumer credit to continue. ""With increases like these,"" he said, ""sooner or later, the consumer has to run out of gas.""</br></br>The Fed report showed that consumer credit grew at a 19.75% annual rate in July, compared with an average annual pace of 24% during the second quarter and 11.5% for all of 1983.

"NEW YORK -- Stock prices surged in heavy trading yesterday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its second-biggest one-day point rise, climbing 66.47 to 2337.07.</br></br>Analysts said the increase reflected relief that the dollar and the bond market appeared to be stabilizing after recent bouts of weakness. Bond prices rallied late yesterday following a shaky start, while the dollar firmed slightly on average, as central banks intervened to support the U.S. currency.</br></br>Even so, analysts were surprised at the magnitude of the stock market rally. ""At the beginning of the week, the bond market looked terrible and people were expecting stocks to go down another 40 or 50 points,"" said Donald Crooks, a top equity trader at Morgan Stanley & Co.

"NEW YORK -- The worst may be over for the mortgage-derivative market. After a savage price decline, there are signs of a bottom in the high-risk market for exotic bonds backed by home mortgages.</br></br>""There's not much that can go wrong now,"" says Greg Parseghian, a Salomon Brothers bond analyst. He is cautiously optimistic because rising interest rates already have wreaked so much havoc on this mercurial market.</br></br>Frequented by investors big and small, from banks and insurers to certain mutual funds, the mortgage-backed securities market is a realm where lots of bonds now sell below par (their face amount). Especially distressed are segments of the market for collateralized mortgage obligations. CMOs are bonds carved from pools of home mortgages into an array of bonds of varying maturity, coupon and risk.</br></br>Many of these bonds, created when rates were lower and homeowners began prepaid mortgages at a furious pace, now languish as much as 75% below their high point last year. But by and large, analysts say, the surprise losses -- and the forced selling -- are over.</br></br>""This market is going through the same thing that junk bonds did in 1990,"" says Edward Sporl, a Greenbrae, Calif., money manager who views the price decline as a buying opportunity. The parallels do seem compelling: Then, as now, underwritings of new bond issues sputtered, forced selling drove down prices, and trading was sporadic."
"The Federal Reserve on Friday released 1,865 pages of transcripts of its behind-closed-doors policy meetings in 2008, the year of the worst financial crisis in generations. The Fed announced the outcome of the meetings right after they occurred, and it released minutes summarizing the discussions a few weeks later. But these documents reveal for the first time officials' verbatim remarks during the heat of many difficult moments that year. Among the insights they provide:</br></br>1. The Fed was often behind the curve</br></br>""A perception has developed that we are tentative and indecisive,"" then-Chairman Ben Bernanke warned his colleagues in January 2008. At times, he moved aggressively to cut short-term interest rates; at others, he held back. After Lehman Brothers collapsed, he thought monetary policy, with short-term interest rates at 2%, was in the right place. By year-end, he acknowledged the Fed was at a ""historic juncture"" and moved aggressively to unconventional policies to avert another depression.</br></br>2. Janet Yellen's forecasting record was mixed</br></br>The current Fed chairwoman said in March 2008 that history would probably show a recession had started in November 2007. That was a good call: The National Bureau of Economic Research put the date at December 2007. Ms. Yellen is highly regarded for her ability to read the economy, but she also makes mistakes. In June 2008, she guessed the Fed's next move would be interest-rate increases to fight inflation before year-end. Instead, the Fed continued cutting rates through the year."
"A major factor in the current financial crisis is the lack of transparency in the activities of the principal players in the financial markets. This opaqueness is compounded by vast sums of money that lie outside the jurisdiction of U.S. regulators and other supervisory authorities.</br></br>The $700 billion in Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's current proposed rescue plan pales in comparison to the volume of dollars that now escape the watchful eye, not only of U.S. regulators, but from the media and the general public as well.</br></br>There is $1.9 trillion, almost all of it run out of the New York metropolitan area, that sits in the Cayman Islands, a secrecy jurisdiction. Another $1.5 trillion is lodged in four other secrecy jurisdictions.</br></br>Following the Great Depression, we bragged about a newly installed safety net that was suppose to save us from such a hard economic fall in the future. However, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve System, the Comptroller of the Currency and others have ignored trillions of dollars that have migrated to offshore jurisdictions that are secretive in nature and outside the safety net -- beyond the reach of U.S. regulators.</br></br>We should have learned a long time ago that totally unsupervised markets, whether trading in tulips or subprime mortgages, will sooner rather than later get into trouble. We don't have to look back very far in history to understand this."
"THE FEDERAL RESERVE pushed up short-term interest rates by one-half percentage point, sending a clear inflation-fighting message. The increase is likely to raise borrowing costs for consumers and businesses: Many big banks raised their prime lending rates after the Fed announcement. The rise also is likely to bolster the dollar against foreign currencies.</br></br>The credit tightening sparked a rally in bond prices, pulling stocks higher. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond soared nearly 1 3/4 points as its yield fell to 7.36%. The Dow Jones industrials rose 24.28 to 3784.57.</br></br>---</br></br>American Home Products and American Cyanamid renewed takeover talks yesterday, even as American Home's unusual one-day offer expired.

Oils, sugars and aircraftsjnade. some sizable gains.</br></br>Some motors, chemicals and selected issues in other groups also advanced smartly. Airlines and rubbers, however, were mainly on the downside.</br></br>Sugars continued their rise as world sugar prices were at their highest levels since the Korean War.

"Trafalgar House, owner of the venerable but troubled Cunard shipping line and its QE2 luxury liner, agreed to a $1.4 billion takeover by Norwegian shipping conglomerate Kvaerner. Kvaerner said it would pay for the acquisition partly by selling $1.53 billion worth of non-core assets, including the Cunard line and the QE2.</br></br>Pharmacia & Upjohn, a drug manufacturer created through the merger of Swedish and U.S. companies, said it will close 40 percent of its 56 factories and research fewer drugs. The moves are intended to save the London-based company $300 million in annual expenses on top of the $500 million in cost cutting already announced. The company also said it will sell its Stockholm-based blood plasma products business.</br></br>Compaq rolled out 35 new desktop personal computers and cut prices of existing models and accessories by an average of 15 percent. Digital Equipment responded to Compaq's move by cutting prices 6 percent to 26 percent on models it sells to businesses. Meanwhile, NEC jumped into the low-price fray with a product series called the PowerMate V, starting at just below $1,300 for models with Pentium 75 MHz microprocessors. And other major computer makers adopted the faster 133 MHz Intel microprocessor for laptop models in a flurry of product revisions.</br></br>T-bill rates were mixed. The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills auctioned yesterday rose to 4.89 percent from 4.86 percent last week. Rates on six-month bills were 4.80 percent, unchanged from the previous week. The actual return to investors is 5.02 percent for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,876.40, and 4.99 percent for a six-month bill selling for $9,757.30.

"The president has now opened the second round of his drive to cut the capital-gains tax rate. That was expected, but it is nevertheless too bad. The whole struggle is a great waste of time and energy for the president, the Congress and the country.</br></br>There is at best only slight evidence that cutting the tax rate will have the positive effects claimed -- on saving, investment, productivity, jobs or revenue. In my opinion, the idea is logically, morally and economically offensive -- but it won't kill us. The important thing now is to get it over with quickly. Then perhaps we can get on with more serious business -- uplifting the underclass, educating our children, controlling drugs and crime, adapting the armed forces to a new security situation, and providing some models of civic virtue, for example.</br></br>Since there is no hope of escaping the capital-gains tax argument, I offer some suggestions that may strike reasonable people as reasonable.</br></br>Inflation Adjustment: There seems to be a great deal of agreement, probably more than is deserved, on adjusting capital gains for inflation. Two problems arise in this connection.</br></br>First, should the inflation adjustment apply to future inflation on assets currently held or should it apply only to inflation on assets acquired after the law is changed? The answer to that is clear, except, of course, to the present holders of assets. Since the motive for the change is primarily to increase the incentive to make a certain kind of investment, there is no point in rewarding the investments that already have been made. The adjustment should apply to assets hereafter acquired."
"NEW YORK -- In the bond market, the wolf isn't at the door. But he is in the neighborhood and headed toward the house.</br></br>That's the view of many investors who have braced for a Democratic presidency by driving up the long-term Treasury bond yield more than one-half percentage point in two months to 7.76%, the highest since midyear.</br></br>Looking ahead, economists and money managers expect bond yields to remain flat to higher until after President-elect Bill Clinton announces his economic program. They don't expect any big surge in yields unless Mr. Clinton does something rash -- such as announce a deficit-widening blitz of short-term government spending. They say the economy is so weak that inflation isn't likely to come roaring back soon.</br></br>""We think that rates could go down or up, but not much in either direction,"" says Ian A. MacKinnon, senior vice president and head of fixed income at Vanguard Group Inc., a mutual fund company. ""Clinton is somewhat of a hostage to the federal deficit, which is going to significantly constrict his ability to launch huge spending programs.""</br></br>Still, the long-term outlook for bonds isn't enticing to many investors. ""We're in the twilight of the bull market,"" says Richard J. Hoffman, chief investment strategist at Cowen & Co., which manages some $1 billion. Over the next year, he says, the yield on the 30-year bond is likely to stay in a trading range of 7.50% to 8% but could rise more the following year."
"Despite their sponsors' best motives, moves to restart the collapsed Doha round of world trade talks at the World Economic Forum in the Davos Swiss resort this week may prove quixotic. In both the U.S. and the EU, which are critical to any advance, trade negotiators face resistance from powerful farm lobbies.</br></br>Started in 2001, the Doha round is meant to help poor countries gain access to the developed world's markets by cutting subsidies and tariffs in rich markets -- especially in agriculture.

"NEW YORK -- As much as everyone would like to see an endless economic expansion, there are some unmistakable signs that the business cycle may finally be entering its downward phase.</br></br>No, Asia's currency troubles of recent months are not one of them. Most economists figure the cause and effects of the turmoil in the currency markets may have a modest negative impact on the U.S. economy but won't derail the expansion -- now six and a half years old and the third longest on record.</br></br>More troublesome, they say, is that for the first time since the end of the last recession in early 1991, businesses are borrowing faster than consumers. The longer this trend persists, economists believe, the greater the chances for a supply/demand imbalance that leaves too many goods and services for too few buyers.</br></br>""The risk to the economy now is overproduction,"" of everything from bagels to athletic shoes to sports utility vehicles, says Merrill Lynch & Co. chief investment strategist Charles Clough. He is concerned that the unusually high debt burden consumers are carrying has finally prompted them to rein in spending. And the combination of weak sales and strong factory output spells trouble for the economy, he said.</br></br>And the potential for a glut could increase, says Mr. Clough, if countries in Southeast Asia decide to solve their financial and economic woes by speeding up production and dumping their output in the U.S."

The F-fund (bonds) return was 2.24 percent, and the never-has-a-bad-day G-fund (Treasury securities) paid 6.01 percent.</br></br>The big drop in the C-fund was expected by workers who have been reading the papers and watching the news. Each snapshot of 12-month returns can present a different picture because one month from the previous year is dropped and the most recent month is added to the calculations.</br></br>For example, the new 12-month figures lead off with April 1993, when the C-fund lost 2.39 percent, and picked up March 1994, when it lost 4.39 percent. That produced the low return for the most recent 12-month period. For the 12-month period that ended in February, the C-fund returned a respectable 8.39 percent. A one-month gain or loss can cause the 12-month rate of return to rise or fall dramatically.</br></br>Taken on a calendar-year basis, all three funds in the tax-deferred federal 401(k) plan have done well. In 1989, the C-fund paid 31.03 percent. In 1990, it lost 3.15 percent, but came back and paid 30.77 percent in 1991, 7.70 percent in 1992 and 10.13 percent last year."
"Venture capitalists never know for sure which energy innovations will succeed, but they've learned a lot about what it takes to give them a chance. The Wall Street Journal's Kimberley A. Strassel discussed the makings of a successful venture with Ray Lane, managing partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and Matthew Rogers, a McKinsey & Co. director and former senior adviser to the secretary of energy for Recovery Act implementation.</br></br>Here are edited excerpts of their conversation.</br></br>MS. STRASSEL: People have come to understand over the past year or two that sometimes energy projects are incredibly capital-intensive, a billion dollars sometimes to create a plant, and sometimes it's going to take seven or eight or years to build one of those. How does a venture-capital market evaluate the risk of that, and do they have the patience and time to do those kinds of investments?</br></br>MR. ROGERS: You're going to have to think through how you deal with existing infrastructure, because you're going to try and displace it in a finite market. You're going to have to understand where all the capital is going to come from during the life cycle, because otherwise it doesn't make sense for a venture capitalist. The idea is to take a lot of risk in an early stage and hope you have enough ownership and liquidity to get a 10X return, because you're going to have a lot of losers in the portfolio.</br></br>MS. STRASSEL: Can venture capital do this alone, though?"

"As the scholar says, history repeats itself.</br></br>At least that's what a lot of Wall Street analysts believe. Or hope. In a year that has gotten off to a shaky and uncertain beginning, historical precedence has become one of the few touchstones remaining on Wall Street.</br></br>Right now analysts have only a cloudy view of what is happening, or what to expect in the next 12 to 18 months. For one thing, government economic statistics have fallen victim to the fiscal paralysis in Washington. Without these guideposts, the view deep into the year has grown very murky. Some analysts expect growth and inflation, and others anticipate recession and bad earnings.

"President Clinton, in a wide-ranging defense of his economic policy, urged the nation today to continue shrinking the federal debt and seeking new trade opportunities to keep the economy strong.</br></br>In what the White House billed as a ""major economic speech,"" the president rejected criticisms of his fiscal strategy--which has largely focused on deficit reduction--from the political left and right.

And he renewed his call for China's membership in the World Trade Organization, which some labor and environmental groups oppose.</br></br>The federal debt reduction that has occurred under his watch ""set in motion a virtuous cycle"" that lowered interest rates and made it easier for businesses to expand and for families to pay off loans for cars, houses and college educations, Clinton told an audience at the University of Pennsylvania. His 44-minute address was the first in an annual lecture series founded by entrepreneur and Clinton political supporter Michael Granoff.</br></br>The president said he will convene ""a major White House conference"" on the economy on April 5. It will include several economists, corporate executives and others to ""focus on the most cutting-edge issues facing the new economy,"" an administration briefing paper said."
"WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve left its key short-term interest rate unchanged, confirming that its fears of imminent inflation have subsided. But economists are divided over whether the central bank will still have to tighten monetary policy in the coming months to damp growth.</br></br>Yesterday's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee was the second consecutive time that Fed officials chose to leave monetary policy alone after pushing through a controversial quarter-point increase in the federal-funds rate in March. The Fed's target for the federal-funds rate, or the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight, remains at 5 1/2%.</br></br>Although the inaction was widely anticipated, the stock market rallied after the decision was disclosed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, down nearly 20 points just before the 2:15 p.m. announcement, ended the day up 73.05 points to close at 7795.38. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond gained 12/32, or about $3.75 for a $1,000 bond, to close at 98 27/32. The yield fell to 6.71% from 6.73%.</br></br>The Fed's decision to keep interest rates at current levels stems from two recent economic developments. First, numerous signs indicate that economic growth in the second quarter slowed from the red-hot 5.9% pace of the first period. Just yesterday, for example, the Commerce Department reported that factory orders fell 0.7% in May, reversing a 1.4% jump in April.</br></br>The second trend giving comfort to the Fed has been inflation's moderation, despite strong growth earlier in the year and an unemployment rate below 5% -- a level most mainstream economists consider likely to trigger higher wages and prices."

"Arnold Schwarzenegger is following the wrong script. After taking over as governor in 2003, he was expected to vanquish business-as- usual politicians in Sacramento -- and pull California from the brink of fiscal ruin. Instead, he has decided to put his own political future ahead of the economic survival of his beloved Golden State. How else to interpret his recent move to join ranks with his opponents in Sacramento to put a pork-heavy $37 billion bond infrastructure proposal on the November ballot?</br></br>Mr. Schwarzenegger's move officially marks the end of his grand plans to reform Sacramento, earning him kudos from many California Democrats. Sen. Don Perata, the most influential Democrat in the state legislature, and Senate Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez have praised Mr. Schwarzenegger's leadership and pledged to campaign with him this fall to promote the initiative. Making joint appearances with prominent Democrats while he is campaigning for re-election will help cement Mr. Schwarzenegger's image as a political moderate, something he has been trying hard to cultivate in this bluest of blue states since last year. That's when the state's public unions accused him of right-wing partisanship, and defeated the bold reform initiatives he put on the ballot to curtail their influence on state government and politics.</br></br>The real issue, however, is what this bond measure will do to California. Few doubt the need for California to invest in its crumbling infrastructure. But this is an infrastructure bond in name only. The four big-ticket items in the bond -- which is two times bigger than the biggest bond in the state's history -- are $2.6 billion for housing, $10.4 billion for K-12 schools and universities, $3.1 billion for levee repairs and $19.2 billion for transportation.</br></br>The housing bond is simply welfare masquerading as a capital project. A bulk of its money won't fund general infrastructure -- an acceptable use of general-obligation bonds like these -- but such things as cheap multifamily dwellings for low-income families, and down-payment assistance for first-time home buyers.</br></br>The education bond is equally misguided, given that 40% of the state's $94 billion general-fund revenues are already constitutionally earmarked for education. Moreover, California voters approved a total of $25 billion for school-construction bonds in 2002 and 2004 to reduce overcrowding. If there is still not enough money for new schools, it is not because of lack of state spending, but abject waste by individual districts. If anything, this handout will encourage more waste by undercutting districts' need to explore the kind of public- private partnership responsible for Inderkum High School in Sacramento being completed a month early and $2.5 million under budget. In this case, a private developer built the school and district authorities used their public dollars to lease the facility from him."
"The White House yesterday called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, even though it publicly maintained the economy is in good shape and that it was not trying to tell central bank officials what to do.</br></br>The unusual comments by presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater came after a meeting of senior White House staff at which Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, expressed concern about the way in which economic growth has slowed and about the reluctance of the Fed to cut interest rates more deeply, Bush administration sources said.</br></br>Also contributing to the critical comments by Fitzwater were an article in yesterday's Wall Street Journal that reported that key Fed officials who earlier had been pushing their colleagues to lower interest rates may no longer be doing so, and the news that housing starts fell sharply last month while December inflation was slightly lower than expected.</br></br>""We're hopeful that {Fed officials} will take a look at this morning's indicators and understand that these numbers are low and indicate that inflation has remained very steady over the last seven or eight years, and that lower interest rates are justified,"" Fitzwater told reporters.</br></br>The Labor Department said yesterday that consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in December, the same increase as the month before. That put the consumer price index 4.6 percent higher than it was in December 1988, only a slightly larger rise than the 4.4 percent figures for 1987 and 1988 but nevertheless the highest rate in eight years."
"With Sunday marking the fourth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act being signed into law, it's worth revisiting the initial purpose of the president's signature legislation: Universal coverage was the main goal. Four years later, not even the White House pretends that this goal will be realized. Most of those who were uninsured before the law was passed will remain uninsured, according to the Congressional Budget Office.</br></br>Democrats also fixated on another goal: protection for people with pre-existing conditions. One of the first things the new law did was create federal risk pools so that people who had been denied coverage for health reasons could purchase insurance for the same premium a healthy person would pay. Over the next three years, about 107,000 people took advantage of that opportunity.</br></br>Think about that. One of the main reasons given for interfering with the health care of 300 million people was to solve a problem that affected a tiny sliver of the population.</br></br>More recently, the president has had to explain why between four million and seven million people are losing their health insurance despite his promise that they would not. The new insurance will be better, he tells us. No longer will insurers be able to cancel your coverage after you get sick. What he doesn't say is that this practice was made illegal at the federal level by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and was illegal in most states long before that.</br></br>While the president and his party struggle to find more convincing reasons why we need ObamaCare, three huge problems won't go away."

People are ready to buy,"" said Harley Rouda, NAR president.</br></br>However, analysts were not as upbeat about reports on car sales in mid-March, which showed sales for the two biggest companies, General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., down substantially from the same period a year ago."
"The Federal Reserve Board's clout isn't what it was during Alan Greenspan's glory days. Back then, the Fed looked and acted all-powerful (even though it wasn't). Now it's visibly failing to unfreeze key debt markets in which giant institutions lend to each other. Those markets have frozen out of fear: No one knows what hidden time bombs are on other firms' balance sheets, or even on their own. The Fed hasn't been able to thaw the markets with interest rate cuts or by using its discount window, through which it lends directly to institutions, and it has been reduced to trying to bribe and cajole big players into borrowing its money as a substitute for borrowing from each other.</br></br>It's not clear whether its recently created ""term auction facility,"" designed to induce institutions to borrow from the Fed, will unfreeze things. The first two auctions were a blowout success. The Fed said it got about $3 in bids for each $1 offered, but I suspect that's because the auctions were for a relatively small $20 billion each and because the Fed and its allies jawboned institutions to bid.</br></br>Am I really saying that the Fed, which to many people still seems omniscient and omnipotent, has lost much of its mojo? I am. Why should you care? Because if the Fed continues to lose clout, it will be even harder than it is now to rescue the world's financial system when the next disaster strikes the markets. And there's always a next disaster.</br></br>The mojo minimization isn't all the Fed's fault, of course. The United States has become less dominant financially, thus reducing the Fed's global influence. Meanwhile, markets have become enormous and transnational and, thus, harder to influence.</br></br>Part of the problem is of the Fed's own making. Its power has always depended more on its reputation than on its actual resources. The Fed lost credibility for not trying to pop the stock bubble of the 1990s or the recent housing bubble; it obsessed about nonexistent deflation; it even (unintentionally) exacerbated the housing bubble by not stopping institutions it regulates from offering dangerous products, such as ""liar's loans"" and the teaser-rate mortgages that now plague the financial system. Finally, it keeps bailing out the enablers of financial excess while penalizing prudent Americans by reducing the rates that their savings earn and accelerating the dollar's decline relative to commodities and foreign currencies."

"Might the $5.9 billion stumble Citigroup Inc. disclosed Monday -- the cost of its part in the credit crunch -- also cost Chief Executive Charles Prince his job? In place for four years to the day and under growing pressure to turn around the largest U.S. bank by market capitalization, he has been unable to significantly lift its stock price, which has been underperforming the prices of its peers. Perhaps the 2.25% rise in the big bank's price Monday was due to more than just the reduced uncertainty about the credit crunch's impact.</br></br>Like other Wall Street firms, Citigroup has been beset by the credit-markets turmoil that sidelined many investors and is saddled with loans it had expected to sell. Its news came hours after UBS AG said it will post a third-quarter loss and make changes following $3.44 billion of write-downs in its fixed-income portfolio. But while Citigroup's massive balance sheet can easily absorb the hit, the situation has called into question its ability to manage its risk appropriately. Last month, for example, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reported unexpectedly strong results despite the market unrest, in part due to savvy bets that the value of home loans and related securities would fall.</br></br>Not surprisingly, the news that Citigroup's third-quarter earnings will fall as much as 60% prompted a fresh round of calls for Mr. Prince to step down. After all, he had been promising a turnaround and had called 2007 a ""year of no excuses."" Importantly, however, Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the largest individual shareholder in Citigroup, said Monday that he fully supports the bank's management -- including Mr. Prince.</br></br>Meanwhile, new UBS CEO Marcel Rohner, having led his bank through one of the more spectacular bloodlettings of the global credit crisis, now must work out how to shore up the bank amid the departure of key executives and the repercussions of a very bad bet on U.S. mortgages. The changes and strategy he unveiled Monday amount to a retrenchment as the Swiss bank slashes by nearly a third the assets of the investment-banking unit that has helped lead its growth in recent years. It will need to rely more heavily on its traditional money- management business and will place a pair of conservative Swiss managers in the top financial and operating posts.</br></br>---"
"NEW YORK -- The bond market wound up the year on a quiet note as prices drifted lower in light trading.</br></br>Some 30-year Treasury bonds fell 1/2 point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount. The U.S. government securities market closed at about 2 p.m. Wednesday and was closed yesterday for New Year's Day.</br></br>In the final three sessions of 1986, prices of some long-term Treasury bonds slumped nearly two points, or almost $20 for each $1,000 face amount.

These developments, along with a sharp increase in the price of gold Wednesday, have intensified fears among some investors about the inflation outlook.</br></br>Most forecasters in recent surveys still expect higher bond prices in coming months because they say the Federal Reserve System probably will drive down interest rates in an effort to rejuvenate the economy.

"One of the questions facing Congress as it moves toward action on an urban aid package is whether enterprise zones represent an efficient way to fight poverty.</br></br>The long-range urban aid legislation now being discussed in Congress almost certainly will include such zones, which some conservative Republicans have advocated as sound urban policy for the last decade.</br></br>President Bush has made enterprise zones a key part of his proposed six-point urban agenda.

Some other bond funds, by contrast, have eked out recent gains that partly offset investors' stock-market pain.</br></br>The recent performance of junk bonds shouldn't be any surprise to investors familiar with the odd hybrid nature of below-investment-grade bonds. ""Sometimes these securities trade with the general bond market and sometimes they trade with the stock market,"" says Earl McEvoy, manager of Vanguard Fixed-Income Securities High-Yield Fund. Lately, it's been much closer to the stock market.</br></br>But ""too often,"" Mr. McEvoy says, investors assume a high-yield fund is simply that -- ""just another bond fund with a higher yield."" In a period like the past several weeks -- when stock prices tumbled but government-bond prices rose -- he says investors may assume mistakenly that their junk-bond funds are comfortably holding their ground.</br></br>That certainly hasn't been the case. Since the stock-market peak on July 17, Lipper Analytical Services Inc.'s high-yield fund index has posted a negative 9.0% return. That's not as bad as the performance of most stock funds, such as the 15.7% decline for the Lipper Growth Fund Index. But it is sharply worse than the positive 3.1% return on a Lipper index of government-bond funds and a positive 2.0% return on its index of funds holding high-quality (A-rated) corporate bonds."
"Author: Katy Burne</br></br>NEW YORK--Johnson & Johnson is set to price its $1.1 billion, two-part bond offering at the lowest rates ever for 10-year and 30-year bonds, in a sign that investors are continuing to bet on corporate debt at a time of record-low interest rates on government bonds.</br></br>Corporations with the best credit ratings have been able to take advantage of this demand and raise cash very cheaply. Some of the best-known issuers that have tapped the debt markets at near record-low rates in recent weeks include International Business Machines Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</br></br>The tranches on the deal are split equally, with $550 million in each maturity bucket, and the issuer is on track to borrow at interest rates around 3.10% for the 10-year maturity and 4.5% for the 30-year paper if market conditions hold, according to one person familiar with the sale.</br></br>The lowest rates on record for these maturities to date were scored in recent weeks by McDonald's Corp. and Northern States Power Co. of Minnesota, a subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc."
"John Hofmeister ("","" op-ed, Feb. 8) makes some excellent observations about the sorry state of industry in the U.S., but his analysis about what went wrong is off-base. Innovation cuts both ways when it comes to jobs. Sometimes it creates them, but often it results in doing more with less--as in people.</br></br>Further, ""shipping jobs overseas"" is less supply-chain driven than a chasing of lower labor costs in the face of global competition. American workers' wage and benefits demands priced them out of the world market in many of the industries Mr. Hofmeister laments.</br></br>Thus, while most of his proposed ideas about shifting corporate tax incentives will do some good no matter what, bringing back manufacturing to the U.S. will require much more. Until we have a cultural and legal shift in expectation about what constitutes appropriate compensation, those jobs will stay where they are.</br></br>Susan Michaelson</br></br>Radnor, Pa."

"Fears of a double dose of economic bad news‰ÛÓworsening inflation accompanied by a recession this fall-receded yesterday as the government reported a decline in a key barometer of prices, a pickup in production by the nation‰Ûªs factories and an unexpected shrinkage of the trade deficit.</br></br>In the ongoing debate over the direction of the U.S. economy, analysts said the reports indicated that economic growth will continue in the months ahead and that a surge of inflation sparked by rising oil prices is disappearing.</br></br>The Federal Reserve had these goals when it began raising interest rates last year in an effort to slow economic growth in order to keep inflation from getting out of hand. President Bush and other key administration officials in recent weeks have signaled that they now want the Fed to lower interest rates to ‰ÛÏThe numbers reinforce the feeling of a soft landing for the economy,‰Û said Samuel Kahan, chief economist for Kleinwort Benson Government Securities in Chicago. ‰ÛÏNone of them suggest any acceleration either in economic activity or in inflation‰Û but they also do not point toward recession, he said.</br></br>The Labor Department reported that falling energy prices were responsible for a 0.4 percent decline in See PRICES, D13, Coll</br></br>the overall index of prices charged by producers of goods ready for sale to ^he, public. After increasing sharply earlier this year, gasoline prices have dropped by nearly one-fourth in the past three months, pushing down the overall index each month. In a separate report, the Fed said production at factories, mines and utilities rose 0.3 percent in August, the strongest gain since April. The increase was due largely to stepped-up automobile and truck production and gpins in coal mining after thousands of striking miners returned to work."
"As the House and Senate move to finalize regulatory-overhaul legislation, the Federal Reserve has emerged as likely to retain most of the power and independence Fed officials have feared they might lose.</br></br>On Thursday, senators on a panel meant to reconcile competing versions of the bill voted 10-2 to kill a provision that would have made the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York a White House appointment. The position is now an internal Fed appointee. Fed officials said the change would have politicized the institution.</br></br>Lawmakers' efforts to remake the Fed comes amid popular angst directed toward the central bank for its failure to head off the financial crisis and for the dramatic corporate rescues it engineered.</br></br>A rethink of the Fed has been part of the broader financial overhaul legislation expected to be completed in Congress this month. The House-Senate conference also has resisted a House attempt -- popular in Congress but adamantly opposed by the Fed -- to subject the Fed's interest-rate decisions to regular audits by the Government Accountability Office, which Congress oversees.</br></br>In a tentative compromise, the GAO would gain authority to scrutinize the Fed's 2008 crisis decisions and the Fed would disclose, with a two-year lag, details of loans it makes to banks through its discount window. The Fed now does not disclose discount window loans."
"Your Aug. 24 editorial ""Fannie Mug"" presents an argument about the role Fannie Mae plays in mortgage finance that is plainly wrong. You also make a proposal for an alternative mortgage finance system that is just wrongheaded.</br></br>For more than 50 years, Fannie Mae has served every region of the country, at all times, in good housing markets and bad, bringing lower cost mortgage rates to Americans of modest means. The average annual saving to the homeowner whose loan we buy or securitize amounts to nearly $400. This year alone we will serve two million American families and add substantial liquidity to a mortgage market that will see an astounding $700 billion in new originations. We are the largest private investor in multifamily housing, and 18 months ago announced a commitment to purchase $10 billion in loans by the end of 1994, specifically targeted to low- and moderate-income families. Finally, largely because of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, there has been no credit crunch for home buyers throughout the recession.</br></br>Yet you propose scrapping the current smoothly functioning mortgage finance system of which we are a part. It would be replaced by one that would lead to higher mortgage rates and severe liquidity problems. Substituting Fannie Mae's role in mortgage finance with a purely private system may satisfy a theoretical and ideological goal. It would, however, deny consumers the advantages they now have, and subject them to a new system whose effectiveness has not yet been tested.</br></br>Consumers would no longer be served by companies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are limited to one industry-housing finance. Instead, the market would be served by companies able to pick and choose whether, and at what price, to fund homeownership. The mugging mentioned in the title of your editorial would surely take place, and the home buyer would be the victim.</br></br>You implied that we receive a $4 billion federal subsidy. No fewer than five studies by the Office of Management and Budget, the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office have found that any governmental benefits we receive flow directly to consumers. The risk-based capital requirement in the pending ""government-sponsored entities"" legislation is, contrary to the editorial's assertion, far tougher than bank and thrift risk based standards. It requires us to capitalize against credit and interest rate conditions so severe that were those conditions to become real, they would amount to nothing short of economic catastrophe for the nation, not just Fannie Mae."

The move was followed by a host of smaller banks.</br></br>The 21 Vz percent rate was the highest that key lending charge had ever reached, surpassing the 20 percent record it touched last spring, just before a sharp decline in interest rates that continued into the summer.

"The U.S. economy ended 1987 on an apparently healthy note despite all the worries following the stock market plunge in October, with the number of people with jobs still rising and the civilian unemployment rate dropping to 5.8 percent, the lowest level since mid-1979, the Labor Department reported yesterday.</br></br>Civilian employment was up 2.8 million during 1987, growing 240,000 last month. Over the course of the year, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell from 6.7 percent to 5.8 percent, the department said. The rate was 5.9 percent in November.</br></br>In addition, the number of unemployed workers seeking jobs last month dipped under 7 million for the first time since early 1980, a drop of nearly 1 million in the past 12 months.</br></br>""The labor market showed strength throughout most of last year, and the December figures continued that pattern of growth,"" said Janet L. Norwood, commissioner of labor statistics.</br></br>Payroll employment increased by 326,000 jobs last month, substantially more than most analysts had been expecting. Nearly one-third of the new jobs were in goods-pro-ducing industries, including a gain of 40,000 in manufacturing. After lagging behind other parts of the economy for several years, manufacturers added 406,000 jobs during 1987, partly in response to a large increase in demand for U.S, goods in foreign markets."
"Activity in the eurozone's private sector picked up only modestly in December, according to surveys of purchasing managers, an indication that the currency area's economy is ending the year on a weak footing.</br></br>The surveys also found that businesses again cut their prices in the face of weak demand, a development that will concern the European Central Bank, which is struggling to raise the currency area's inflation rate from the very low level it has settled at for more than a year.</br></br>Data firm Markit on Tuesday said its composite purchasing managers index--a measure of activity in the manufacturing and services sectors in the currency bloc--rose to 51.7 in December from 51.1 in November. A reading below 50.0 indicates activity is declining, while a reading above that level indicates it is increasing.</br></br>Preliminary results from Markit's survey of 5,000 manufacturers and service providers also showed that a significant pickup in activity is unlikely in the coming months, with new orders up only marginally following November's decline.</br></br>The surveys also found that businesses continued to cut their prices, although at a slightly less aggressive pace."
"Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said yesterday that economic conditions in several hard-hit Asian nations have deteriorated in recent weeks and the fallout is ""only now just being felt"" by the U.S. economy.</br></br>Greenspan, testifying along with Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman before the House Agriculture Committee, said that part of the progress several nations made early this year in stabilizing their economies has been reversed. Until the situation ""fully stabilizes, we can't really have confidence"" that the Asian problems won't spread further through the world financial system, he said.</br></br>Concern about the potential for such a ""contagion"" effect, and the increasing drag from the Asian situation on U.S. economic growth, are among the reasons the Fed hasn't raised interest rates this year to head off any possible acceleration of inflation. Fed policymakers last met Tuesday and left rates unchanged.</br></br>At a March 31 Fed policymaking session, minutes of which were released yesterday, the uncertainty of ""the ultimate extent of retarding effects for the financial turmoil in Asia"" was among the reasons given by officials for not raising rates at that time.</br></br>According to the minutes, the Fed policymakers expressed worry that rapid U.S. economic growth and tight labor markets would eventually lead to higher inflation if they persist. But most of the officials ""saw little urgency to tighten policy at this meeting,"" the minutes said. "". . . The economy might well continue to accommodate relative robust economic growth and a high level of resource use {meaning very low unemployment} for an extended period without a rise in inflation."""
"NEW YORK -- Economists padded their industrial production estimates -- grudgingly in some cases -- after February's robust payroll report.</br></br>The stronger job data are likely to be reflected in Friday's reports on output and capacity utilization, but analysts warn of several quirks in the employment numbers. What's more, they flag February's producer price index data as a reminder of troublesome inflation.</br></br>The week also holds reports on February housing starts and permits, retail sales and auto sales, and January's business inventories. Like the job figures, many of these reports can be swayed by seasonal factors or the stop-and-go auto industry.</br></br>Nonetheless, many economists were upgrading their output forecasts and thinking about raising their gross national product estimates last Friday after the job data were released.</br></br>""The numbers are the numbers, and that's the problem with this game,"" said Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Co. Mr. Kudlow concedes he's considering raising his first-quarter GNP estimate of 1.5% by as much as a full percentage point after plugging the jobs numbers -- flawed or not -- into the GNP formula."
"STOCKS CAN'T SHAKE the post-Christmas blues.</br></br>In listless holiday-season trading, investors appeared to give up hopes for a year-end rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished yesterday virtually unchanged for 2005, down 11.44 points, or 0.11%, at 10784.82. With one trading day left in the year, the industrials were just an eyelash above last year's close of 10783.01, in danger of sinking into the red after two years of gains.</br></br>Trading volume was among the year's lightest. Other major indexes also fell, putting them slightly ahead for the year.</br></br>The day's news was downbeat.</br></br>The bond market again ""inverted,"" meaning that yields of two-year Treasury notes moved higher than those of 10-year notes. Normally, investors demand higher yields for longer-term investments.

The yield of the two-year note finished at 4.381%, and that of the 10-year note was 4.368%."
"A series of disappointments--arrests, marital separation and unemployment--beset Jose Pimentel's life before he turned to a radical strain of Islam and, authorities say, began planning a pipe-bombing plot targeting government workers.</br></br>He was arrested twice in two years--once at the age of 19 in New York City on charges of selling marijuana in 2004 and then again in 2005 on charges of using stolen credit-card information to buy a computer, according to court records.</br></br>In 2010, Mr. Pimentel, a Dominican Republic-born U.S. citizen, and his wife separated, said his mother. They have a 4-year-old son.</br></br>And though Mr. Pimentel found work doing odd jobs, he was mostly unemployed for the past several years, said his mother, Carmen Sosa. After moving back in with his mother in 2010, Mr. Pimentel spent most of his time in his bedroom, where authorities say he maintained a website that advocated violence against Americans and followed the teachings of the now-dead al Qaeda propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki.</br></br>""When I talk to him about what you're doing, he said, 'It's not your business,'"" Ms. Sosa, 56, said in a televised interview."
"Friday's weak employment report reminds us anew of the flagging U.S. economic recovery. While the Obama administration discusses additional stimulus packages, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner is arguing that we should roll back key elements of the Bush tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003. The administration is particularly skeptical about the benefits of today's lower rates on dividends and capital gains.</br></br>The tax on dividends, for example, is currently 15%, but it could increase to as high as 39.6% if the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire. On top of this, a new 3.8% tax on investment incomes for high-income earners begins in 2013 to help pay for ObamaCare. The administration's arguments for higher taxes on capital center on fairness and the need for deficit reduction.</br></br>These arguments are seriously mistaken. The relationship between investment, capital and wages is such that workers are better off if capital is not taxed at all.</br></br>Think of the economy as a pie split among workers, savers and the government, with the government's slice fixed. The savers' slice will equal the after-tax return on each unit of the capital stock, and what's left goes to workers as after-tax wages. The fairness advocates in effect claim that low tax rates on dividends and capital gains increase the share of the pie that goes to high-income savers. But the low tax rates increase the absolute size of the workers' slice by making the entire pie bigger. That's because low tax rates encourage capital accumulation, productivity and wage growth.</br></br>To understand how this works, it's worthwhile to return to President Bush's proposal, in January 2003, to substantially reduce the double taxation of corporate income by eliminating investor-level taxes on dividends. (The actual law reduced tax rates on dividends and capital gains to 15%.)"
"One after another, trade ministers stepped to the podium here this week and called on the United States to put its fiscal house in order.</br></br>But the paradox underlying the meeting here of the 95 nations that belong to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is that many countries fear that the Reagan administration and Congress actually will get together and make meaningful cuts in the U.S. budget deficit.</br></br>That would likely cause a contraction in the U.S. economy, which other countries expect would hurt sales of their exports to the United States.</br></br>While this would help ease the United States' stubborn trade deficit, which has soared to record heights for four straight years, it could plunge many countries whose growth depends on exports to the United States into economic recession or worse.</br></br>For while the budget deficit has brought instability and uncertainty to world financial markets and caused the U.S. dollar to plunge to record lows, it also has fed economic expansion in the United States, which has become the locomotive for world growth in this decade."
"NEW YORK -- Stocks ended more than a week of divergence by falling in unison.</br></br>High-tech stocks, one of the few sectors to hold up in recent trading, lost ground, as investors took profits in high-priced issues. That halted a streak of seven straight gains by the Nasdaq Composite Index.</br></br>Blue-chip issues such as Microsoft lost 5 15/16 to 104, while Intel, coming off a 52-week high Tuesday, declined 4 3/16 to 104 5/8 (both on the Nasdaq Stock Market), and Motorola declined 6 13/16 to 153 9/16.</br></br>Meanwhile, several of the momentum-driven high-tech issues that had persisted in the face of a broad decline in recent sessions got caught in the sell-off. Yahoo! fell 10 13/16 to 362 5/16, while Commerce One eased 9 3/4 to 155 3/8, and Conexant Systems, also coming off a 52-week high, fell 7 to 104 15/16, all on Nasdaq.</br></br>Some technology issues managed to gain. Juniper Networks rose 16 5/16 to 185 15/16, and Vitesse Semiconductor climbed 5 13/16 to 55 13/16, both on Nasdaq. Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq), after an upbeat research note from Bear Stearns, gained 4 9/16 to 91 9/16. Nortel Networks advanced 1 3/4 to 122. Rival Lucent Technologies fell 1 1/8 to 53."
"MEXICO CITY -- Mexico may be starting to suffer from too much of a good thing. That has authorities worried.</br></br>Good news since the year's start -- including the surging price of oil, falling inflation and the decision by Moody's Investors Service Inc. this month to elevate the country to investment grade -- has strengthened the peso by more than 4%, reignited domestic demand and caused a deterioration in the trade balance.</br></br>All of this makes Mexico vulnerable to a sharp economic correction if the price of oil, Mexico's single largest export, falls more than expected, or if the economy of the U.S. -- the country's largest trading partner -- slows precipitously.</br></br>""I've seen this movie before and I don't want to see it again,"" central-bank governor Guillermo Ortiz says. ""It's a bad movie.""</br></br>Problem is, there isn't much authorities can do to choke off rising domestic demand. Monetary policy, exercised through the corto, a mechanism that drains liquidity from the interbank market, is already tight. So, too, is fiscal policy, despite the room for relaxation afforded by strong oil prices in the past year. There is little political incentive to put an end to the fiesta, given that the most fiercely contested presidential election in Mexican history takes place in early July and that the purchasing power of most people here still hasn't recovered to the levels they enjoyed when President Ernesto Zedillo took office in 1994."
"House leaders are weighing a plan to raise lawmakers' salaries without a direct vote on the politically sensitive question when the House considers the spending bill covering congressional pay in the next two weeks, according to congressional officials familiar with the matter.</br></br>The leaders also would like to find a way to ease the House ban on all gifts to lawmakers and their aides, but have yet to settle on a plan, the officials said.</br></br>Lawmakers have not had a raise in their salaries -- which now stand at $133,600 for a rank-and-file member -- since 1993 and have voted annually to cancel the cost-of-living adjustment to which they are entitled under the law. Congressional leaders have higher salaries, with House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) getting $171,500.</br></br>The House version of the bill funding the Treasury Department and general government operations is headed to the House floor without any provision exempting lawmakers from the automatic 2.8 percent inflation adjustment that is to go to federal employees in the spending year beginning Oct. 1. Under a plan receiving serious consideration, House leaders would use a routine parliamentary procedure to block -- without a vote -- any attempt to add an exemption for lawmakers, the officials said.</br></br>That would avoid lawmakers having to go on record as making a politically difficult vote on the question, although they still would have to vote to pass the overall bill."

"New Japanese investment in the U.S. will slow from last year's record pace but will remain significant, analysts say. Japanese investors also are expected to accelerate the diversification of their U.S. holdings away from bonds and into equities and real estate.</br></br>The major factors behind the expected shifts are the weak U.S. dollar and relatively low U.S. interest rates.</br></br>Salomon Brothers Inc. projects that private Japanese investors will purchase the equivalent of about $115 billion of foreign assets in 1987, down from a record $132.4 billion last year. Much of these funds are either invested in the U.S. or in Eurodollar bonds. The New York-based investment firm estimates that 85% to 90% of Japanese purchases of foreign stock and 70% of the fixed-income securities purchases have been dollar-denominated, including U.S. government, agency and corporate debt and Eurodollar securities.</br></br>A slowdown in new Japanese investment in the U.S. could have far-reaching implications. Foreign purchases of U.S. government and other dollar-denominated investments have helped fund the U.S. budget deficit, keep U.S. interest rates low and prevent the dollar from crashing. And the Japanese have played a leading role.</br></br>Japan's long-term foreign assets at the end of last year totaled nearly $397 billion -- higher than the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' peak holdings of $380 billion in 1983. Japanese trading in U.S. Treasury securities climbed fivefold in the past 17 months and now accounts for as much as 15% of daily turnover, according to Michael R. Rosenberg, a vice president at Merrill Lynch & Co. ""They are an important force in our market and are going to remain such,"" he adds."

"After an often vigorous 6 1/2-year expansion that put 17.5 million more Americans to work, the U.S. economy appears to be entering an extended period of slow growth that will squeeze income gains for many Americans.</br></br>The onset of this slowdown has been signaled in several ways recently. Consumer spending for new cars and other expensive, long-lasting goods is down substantially from last year's levels. Fewer new homes are being constructed and sold. New orders for a wide range of goods, an indicator of future production and employment levels, slumped in May.</br></br>On Friday, the Labor Department reported that unemployment rose last month to 5.3 percent from 5.2 percent in May. The number of new jobs now being created is down from the pace of 1988.</br></br>Mounting evidence of the slowdown persuaded the Federal Reserve to ease its grip on credit again last week and most banks are expected to drop their prime lending rate this week, from 11 percent to 10.5 percent.</br></br>By this careful steering, the Fed continues to seek a ""soft landing"" in which credit remains tight enough and economic growth slow enough to keep inflation under control without forcing a sharp downward slide into a recession."
"A MAJOR EFFORT to lower the dollar against foreign currencies and head off a possible trade war was unveiled by the U.S. and four other nations. The plan involves U.S. intervention in financial markets, efforts to trim U.S. budget deficits and steps to spur growth in Europe and Japan.</br></br>Congressional leaders expressed relief at the initiative, but businessmen and economists were skeptical.</br></br>---</br></br>Interest rates may ease at first due to efforts to force the dollar down, but could eventually move higher, according to many bankers and analysts. A coordinated plan also reduces the possibility that the Fed will tighten credit soon, they said.</br></br>---"
"The National Association of Securities Dealers, pushing forward with its proposed plan to sell off part of the Nasdaq Stock Market, set April 14 as the date for a membership meeting to vote on the plan and mailed out proxy materials to its 5,500 member firms.</br></br>The NASD also opened the process by which qualified potential investors can ask for shares in Nasdaq as part of the offering, which is expected to raise roughly $1 billion.</br></br>The NASD's plan would sell Nasdaq to its members, market-making firms, listed companies and others in a two-step private-placement transaction. The first step would bring the NASD's stake in Nasdaq down to between 47% and 49%, while the second step would reduce that stake further, to around 22%.</br></br>In order for the transaction to go into effect, its first phase requires an affirmative vote by a majority of the firms voting, while the second phase has a higher bar, requiring an approval by a majority of all members.</br></br>NASD Chairman Frank Zarb, who hosted several live town-hall meetings late last year while the plan was being put together, says he will preside over a series of conference calls with members to go over the materials in the private-placement memorandum and answer questions. In an interview, he said six such meetings already are planned, with the first an all-member call planned for tomorrow."
"The government said yesterday its main economic forecasting gauge plummeted 0.6 percent in April. It was the biggest decline in two years and provided evidence, private economists said, that the U.S. economy is slowing down.</br></br>The Commerce Department's Index of Leading Indicators posted its biggest setback since a 0.8 percent fall in April 1985. The setback followed a revised 0.8 percent increase in March.</br></br>While analysts said they did not believe the huge drop signaled an impending recession, they said the index has been flashing signals of slower growth since the beginning of the year.</br></br>""The economy does not look too good right now,"" said Michael Penzer, senior economist at Bank of America in San Francisco. ""Almost every piece of information we have had in the past two weeks suggests the economy was barely moving along in April.""</br></br>Economic growth, as measured by the gross national product, spurted to a 4.4 percent annual rate in the January-March quarter, the fastest pace in almost three years."
"The lawyers and accountants who are trying to collect money for the depositors of BCCI, the failed international bank, yesterday filed a $55 million lawsuit against Clark M. Clifford, Robert A. Altman and 15 other Washington lawyers.</br></br>The civil lawsuit alleges that Clifford and Altman, as lawyers for the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and for First American Bankshares Inc., had ""an irreconcilable conflict of interest"" because of their simultaneous representation of the two institutions.</br></br>BCCI was closed down by regulators around the world in 1991 following revelations of widespread fraud, causing billions of dollars in losses to depositors abroad. The bank illegally owned four U.S. banks, including First American, which was run by former defense secretary Clifford and his protege Altman for a decade before regulators ordered it sold.</br></br>The lawsuit, filed by BCCI liquidators in federal court in the District, seeks to recoup allegedly ""illicit benefits"" that went to Clifford and Altman, including $6 million BCCI paid them in legal fees and $9 million the two made from ""lucrative insider stock transactions and other beneficial financial arrangements,"" according to court papers.</br></br>While acting as lawyers for the BCCI group, Clifford and Altman borrowed $15 million from BCCI at favorable interest rates in 1986 to purchase stock in BCCI's parent company. That money was a non-recourse loan, one backed only by the stock itself."

"WHEN AUTO makers wanted to keep cars moving off dealers' lots, they offered zero-percent financing. Now some home builders, worried that rising interest rates may clip the pace of new sales, have gotten into the act by making cheaper financing available to home buyers.</br></br>While the builders aren't offering no-interest loans, in some areas they are undercutting the rates offered by more traditional lenders. To entice buyers, big national builders such as KB Homes and smaller developers such as Estridge Companies in Carmel, Ind., are providing incentives ranging from below-market loans to offers to lock in low rates for up to six months.</br></br>In formerly hot markets like Denver and Austin, Texas, builders are sweetening financing deals, paying as much as $4,000 on a $200,000 mortgage to cover a buyer's closing costs.</br></br>Rising rates are expected to play an increasingly important role in the housing market during coming months. Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve raised short-term rates for the second time in two months and further increases are expected this year. While mortgage rates don't move directly in tandem with moves by the Fed, they are expected to rise as the Fed continues to rachet up rates.</br></br>The financial enticements from home builders are a relatively new but growing practice that the Fed highlighted last month in its ""beige book"" economic report. In response to rising rates, builders are ""altering their financing products accordingly in an attempt to make them more attractive,"" the Fed noted."

"The District government should significantly reduce real estate taxes and cut personal and corporate income tax rates so it can attract new employers to the city and keep the ones it has, a broad-based business coalition recommended yesterday.</br></br>The tax recommendations were part of a sweeping series of proposals to improve the District's business climate, which generally is perceived by government officials and business leaders as worse than in surrounding jurisdictions.</br></br>Private-sector leaders long have complained about the high cost of operating in the District, but yesterday's 38-page report is the most comprehensive effort yet undertaken by the District's private sector to identify problems and propose solutions.</br></br>The report was written by the Washington Committee, an ad hoc group of more than 240 people who spent the last three months formulating the recommendations. Though most of the Washington Committee comes from business, members also represented nonprofit organizations and several arms of the District government.</br></br>The tax proposals were accompanied by a call for reductions in the D.C. minimum wage, unemployment benefits and workmen's compensation insurance. To make up for the loss of revenue to the District that the tax proposals would entail, the committee suggested imposition of a tax on residents of other jurisdictions who work in the District."
"ASIDE FROM the odd short seller, there aren't many people actively rooting for further stock-market declines. But executive recruiters admit they'd be happy to see the market stumble a bit more.</br></br>""I'm paid to uncouple employment deals and extricate the talent,"" says Peter Crist, of Crist & Partners, Chicago. Extrication was difficult when the bull was roaring and executives were getting rich on options. Now, some of that wealth is vanishing. ""None of us wants a disastrous blow, but a little softening would give us some working room,"" Mr. Crist says. ""If your options are underwater, you're more interested in listening to my overture.""</br></br>The volatility of the stock market has created some interesting career quandaries for senior executives. Market gains aren't covering up mediocre results anymore, so underperformers are feeling the heat. Meanwhile, depressed stock prices can mean bigger profit potential on newly issued options, a potent selling point for recruiters attempting to entice star performers to jump ship.</br></br>Plenty of people are still tuning out the recruiters' siren song, confident that the bull will eventually return, confirming the wisdom of taking a long-range view. Others refuse even to acknowledge the market's role in career decisions, saying that job satisfaction and the potential for increased challenge mean more than money.</br></br>But let's face it: The best senior-level people aren't about to change jobs without a financial incentive.

"WASHINGTON -- Although the economy has long been in the doldrums, more money has been finding its way into the government's coffers than expected.</br></br>The result is that when the figures are all counted, the deficit for fiscal 1992, which ended Sept. 30, should turn out to be about $290 billion. While that would be a record, exceeding the previous year's $269 billion deficit, it's far below the $368 billion that the Congressional Budget Office originally had forecast. The White House budget office once had assumed that the gap would be even greater: a mammoth $399 billion.</br></br>Still, analysts say the surprising improvement for 1992 could prove to be short-lived, and they expect enormous deficits for the foreseeable future.</br></br>Last summer, the CBO and White House pared their deficit projections to $314 billion and $334 billion, respectively -- mostly to reflect delays in deposit-insurance spending for the savings-and-loan cleanup.</br></br>But in the short time since those revisions were made, the government has taken in more revenue than it thought it would, while spending has been somewhat less. The precise reason is unclear. Yet government budget officials say that, among other things, a surprising number of estimated tax payments have been rolling in."
"Housing starts fell to their lowest level in 12 years last month, while permits for new construction also declined, pointing to a further weakening of an already battered housing market.</br></br>Those numbers, as well as a report showing that builder confidence is at a record low, prompted Sen.

"CHICAGO'S Federal Reserve bank takes a fresh look at Midwest manufacturing . . . and gulps a bit at what it finds.</br></br>Measuring ups and downs in employment is the usual way of tracking manufacturing activity. But this method ignores such important factors as the value added in the production process and the speed at which factory equipment is used.</br></br>With the Federal Reserve Board's monthly Industrial Production Index as a guide, economists at the Chicago Fed came up with a Midwest Manufacturing Index to measure factory output in the bank's five-state district -- Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan and Wisconsin.</br></br>Unfortunately, the first tabulation shows Midwest manufacturing activity for June up just 1.4% from a year earlier, compared with a 3.6% increase for the U.S. as a whole. A revised computation for the first eight months of 1987 put Midwest manufacturing up 2.3%, against 3.5% for the nation.</br></br>""I'm not overly concerned,"" says Chicago Fed economist Robert Schnorbus.

The suspect, Gary Dale Hoke of Raleigh, N.C., is an employee of the firm, PairGain Technologies Inc.</br></br>Hoke was released on $50,000 bond yesterday. He faces a charge of securities fraud, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in federal prison and a $1 million fine.</br></br>A federal complaint and affidavit filed against Hoke said he created the fake Bloomberg News Web page that falsely reported that Tustin, Calif.-based PairGain was about to be bought by an Israeli company.</br></br>The fake news story and e-mail messages touting the deal sparked a frenzy of trading in PairGain shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market on April 7. Word of impending acquisitions often leads investors to buy the target company's stock, on the assumption that they will be able to sell it for a better price.

But his education plan would restore the county's contribution to public schools, as measured by per-pupil spending adjusted for inflation, to the level it reached before recession struck in 1991. The spending plan underscores the influence new School Superintendent Jerry D. Weast had in shaping the county budget, which gives the school system virtually its entire request. Duncan is scheduled to present the budget today during a noon news conference at Twinbrook Elementary School in Rockville.</br></br>The size of the spending increase for education can be attributed partly to a school system plan to keep better track of spending and hold teachers more accountable. Duncan had criticized the school system for not having such a plan in place.</br></br>The increase also comes as a strong economy generates windfalls for local governments, and many regional school systems are benefiting. Fairfax County officials recently proposed a 7 percent increase in the public schools budget. In the District, Mayor Anthony A. Williams (D) has proposed a $5 billion budget that includes an $80 million increase for education."

The harbor business affects directly or indirectly 170,000 jobs. Even slight damage to piers, ships or tugboats can cost thousands of dollars in repairs and lost productivity. Tugboats that in the past were riveted with pieces of old Navy destroyers and derelict banana boats today cost an estimated $2 million to build..</br></br>‰ÛÏThere‰Ûªs no little damage done when damage is done,‰Û says Francis Lukowski, 36, a captain who works for McAllister Brothers, a rival to Curtis Bay Towing.

"How's this for high-concept television: A great network lifts itself out of the ratings cellar and rides high for three years. Then, all at once, things get rocky. The network loses its top programming executive, its high-profile sports shows, even some of its affiliates. As executives search desperately for a new hit, the ratings start to look shaky again.</br></br>This scenario, as they say on TV, is based on a true story. CBS, the dominant television network of the early '90s, appears headed for a fall. Despite winning a ratings triple crown during the last television season - taking the top spot in the prime time, daytime and late night Nielsens - in recent months the network of ""Murphy Brown"" and ""Late Night With David Letterman"" has been showing clear signs of deterioration.</br></br>Last week, Black Rock, as CBS's New York headquarters is known, was shaken anew. New World Communications Group Inc., which owns eight TV stations affiliated with CBS, said it was shifting its loyalties to Rupert Murdoch's Fox network. The move was widely read as a coup for Fox, which paid $500 million for the stations' affiliation, and as a major defeat for CBS. Indeed, the stock market's judgment was swift and harsh: Investors rushed to sell their CBS shares, knocking nearly $520 million off the company's value on paper in two days (the stock recovered slightly later in the week).</br></br>CBS executives argue that the reaction to the New World-Fox deal was overblown. After all, they said, with its powerful prime time lineup, CBS should have no trouble persuading other stations in the eight markets to sign up to carry ""60 Minutes,"" ""Murder, She Wrote"" and other CBS fare. Fox, sniffed CBS Broadcasting Group President Howard Stringer last week, is a network of ""downscale sitcoms and titillating soap operas.""</br></br>In fact, Fox - whose ratings have declined 10 percent in the past two years - needs the soon-to-be former CBS affiliates more than CBS. Once it finds stations to replace those it has lost, CBS's ""worst case"" internal projections call for it to lose about 15 percent of its current audience in the eight cities."
"PARIS -- Cap Gemini Ernst & Young warned that sales and profitability would fall short of earlier guidance because of delays in signing contracts, triggering a sharp selloff in shares of Europe's largest technology-services company.</br></br>Shares in the French company fell more than 13% in Paris trading to 35.83 euros ($44.11). The stock price had more than doubled since last winter, amid tentative signs of an improvement in technology spending and Cap Gemini's own prospects. In a high-profile win over U.S. rival Electronic Data Systems Corp., Cap Gemini last week took home a 10- year outsourcing contract from Britain's tax authority valued at over GBP 3 billion ($5.2 billion).</br></br>But yesterday's profit warning, the company's second this fall, prompted analysts to question its financial reporting and ability to capitalize on any upturn in business technology spending.</br></br>Chief Executive Paul Hermelin had earlier blamed inadequate reporting systems for a series of revenue warnings following Cap Gemini's 2000 acquisition of Ernst & Young LLP's consulting activities, and vowed that those days were over. Questions are resurfacing.</br></br>Pauline Cieutat, an analyst with CIC Securities, said the company's latest warning shows ""the fragility of the group's financial communications and of its reporting system."""
"MOSCOW -- Russia's central bank raised interest rates for the second time in less than a month, giving up efforts to shore up its slumping currency and bond markets with direct intervention.</br></br>The move came late in the day as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank seemed set to step in with nearly $2 billion in loans by year end.</br></br>A senior U.S. administration official suggested yesterday that more IMF assistance could be made available if Russia improved its tax collection record. That ""would make it possible for the IMF to help them through any problems they might have,"" Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said.</br></br>The World Bank is going to provide about $800 million in the next several months, he added, as part of its ""important support of ongoing structural reform"" in Russia. And German Chancellor Helmut Kohl Sunday pledged to help Russia win more financial support.</br></br>Early yesterday, the Russian central bank sharply raised its daily intervention limit for the dollar. The ruble recorded its sharpest one-day drop this year, falling to the central bank's limit of 5,963 rubles per dollar from 5,931 Friday. Government bond prices also plunged.

"Deciding on which country's debt to invest in comes down to three basic points, said bond king Bill Gross, which include a central bank's ability to use low or negative real interest rates to reflate its economy without creating a currency crisis.</br></br>In his monthly missive, the managing director of Pacific Investment Management Co. said, ""2010 promises to be the year of choosing 'which government' can most successfully substitute the governments' fist for Adam Smith's invisible hand and for how long. Can individual countries escape a debt crisis by creating even more debt and riding another rocking horse winner? Can the global economy?""</br></br>To figure that out, Mr. Gross wrote there are many conditions, and they vary by country, but they boil down to three:</br></br>--Can a country issue its own currency and is it acceptable in global commerce?</br></br>--Are a country's initial conditions (outstanding debt, structural deficit, growth rate, demographic balance) moderate and can it issue future public debt as a substitute for private credit?"
"Four regional banks from around the country yesterday became the first firms to repay emergency aid from the government, but the show of strength also underscored concerns about the health of a key element of the federal economic recovery program.</br></br>The Treasury Department has invested almost $200 billion in more than 500 banks to support new lending to consumers and businesses, but the growing clamor among recipients to repay the aid earlier than planned threatens to diminish the impact.</br></br>The largest bank to exit, Signature Bank of New York, which returned $120 million, said it was acting to avoid the effects of congressional restrictions on aid recipients, including limits on pay that could drive away its most productive employees. Chief executive Joseph J. DePaolo also said that the aid had become an undeserved scarlet letter because of public perception that the program was being used to save troubled banks, rather than buttressing healthy firms.</br></br>Other returns included $100 million from Old National Bancorp of Indiana, $90 million from IberiaBank of Louisiana and $28 million from California's Bank of Marin Bancorp.</br></br>The repayments are the latest challenge for the investment program, which was introduced in November with the stated goal of investing $250 billion in thousands of banks.

"The bond vigilantes are acting a lot less vigilant these days.</br></br>There was a time, following the inflation crisis of the early 1980s, when the bond market, regardless of the Federal Reserve's policy, worked to keep a lid on bond prices just to be sure the economy didn't get too steamy. Whenever there were signs that the pace of growth was picking up, the so-called vigilantes would rush to sell, driving interest rates higher and acting as a brake on the economy.</br></br>But if last week was any indication, a new era may be upon us.</br></br>The market is soaring. The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond plummeted to 6.37% from 6.69% in just the past six trading days. Behind it all is a conviction among bond investors and traders that the Federal Reserve won't raise interest rates until inflation actually shows signs of picking up, and recent figures demonstrate that isn't happening, and probably won't, for at least a while.</br></br>Overall, of course, that's good for bonds. But it portends more volatility, and, somewhere down the road, perhaps some brutally painful losses."

"Economy May Be Getting Its Wings Clipped</br></br>Here is the stuff of nightmares: You are piloting a plane that is losing altitude and not responding.</br></br>As the Federal Reserve concludes a two-day meeting Wednesday, it may be presented with fresh data hinting at such a calamity for the U.S. economy. First-class passengers like Mr. Stock Market appear blithely unaware as they enjoy a complimentary beverage. Those crammed in coach are starting to feel some bumps.</br></br>The economy isn't in a recession, but it will probably remain near what economists call ""stall speed"" following Wednesday's report on second-quarter gross domestic product. Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires see annualized growth of just 0.9% -- tied for the second-lowest level of the expansion.</br></br>That follows growth of 1.8% and 0.4% in the previous two quarters.

"Austan Goolsbee, former chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, is on dubious ground in declaring Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's QE era a success and the QE critics wrong (""Bravo for Bernanke and the QE Era,"" op-ed, Jan. 11). There are always tradeoffs and harm from price controls, and quantitative easing has been the most ambitious and far-reaching price-control policy ever attempted. QE's massive bond purchases and money creation eroded market confidence and sidelined capital for many who attributed a phony recovery and an artificial economy to QE. Mohammed El Erian, the CEO of Pimco, the world's largest bond fund manager, points out that Fed creation of money in $4 trillion of QE bond purchases added a mere quarter of 1% (0.25%) to GDP growth -- a lousy tradeoff considering the heightened risks of inflation from QE money expansion and the risks of Fed insolvency from the attendant precipitous fall in bond prices.</br></br>In spite of the rise in asset prices of stocks and real estate from QE policies, it may turn out that far less new wealth was actually created if those prices deflate when QE liquidity is withdrawn.</br></br>QE has been accompanied by the worst post-recession recovery on record since the Great Depression in terms of GDP growth and a 40-year low in the labor-force participation rate. By maintaining interest rates at abnormally low levels, QE masks the real cost of the growing entitlement state while it also helped bailout and re-elect President Obama, resulting in a continuation of failed fiscal policies and the postponement of the day of reckoning on national debt and entitlement reform, which are essential for sustainable economic recovery.</br></br>Scott S.

"The best-performing asset this year is one that will earn you zero interest for the next 20 years.</br></br>Zero-coupon Treasurys maturing in more than 20 years have returned 21% this year through Thursday, the latest data available, beating out investments from stocks to corporate bonds and gold. Zero-coupon Treasurys maturing from 10 to 20 years have handed investors a return of nearly 17% in the same period.</br></br>Investors have flocked to these securities because they offer double protection -- not just against weak economic growth but also against further declines in yields -- a big risk for fixed-income investors. A nominal 10-year Treasury note pays interest twice a year, leaving investors with funds that have to be reinvested as yields continue to decline.</br></br>Last week, the two-year yield hit a record low of 0.545%, while the 10-year benchmark note's yield touched a 15-month low of 2.851%. In late trading Friday, the two-year yield was at 0.592%, while the 10-year benchmark note yielded 2.997%.</br></br>Zero-coupon Treasurys, in contrast, are sold at a discounted price but redeemed at face value. The difference between the two prices represents the investor's profit, which technically amounts to the accumulated interest."
"Financial crises usually come from left field. But that doesn't stop swamis from searching for the next trigger. Right now, the prospect of rising interest rates is focusing swamis on trouble in the bond market. Not a bad bet, since the past few years of falling rates have produced a ton of complicated ways to extract profits from fixed- income securities. Also not a bad bet since a forecast of higher rates is driving investors to unwind positions -- presenting a perfect moment to expose flaws in hedging and other strategies.</br></br>So it's hardly surprising that concentration of risk is Topic One. Consider, for example, a recent speech by the new head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In lovely Fed-speak, Timothy Geithner blended concerns about the increasing vulnerability of the financial system to the growth in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the high degree of concentration in the market for interest-rate options.</br></br>Mr. Geithner was vague in the extreme, but the details of his concern are laid out in a report from Credit Suisse First Boston. Here are the mechanics of a possible crisis scenario in which the particular nature of risk in the mortgage market becomes concentrated in the market for interest-rate options.</br></br>The chain of transmission starts with the mortgage market. (Bear in mind that, at some $7 trillion, this market is enormous.) Mortgages are of course wondrous financial instruments. They allow people, even those with humble means, to own a big asset -- a house -- without having to pay the full price up-front. But mortgages have an almost as wondrous property -- they give home buyers the opportunity to pay off before maturity. This prepayment option allows homeowners to transfer interest-rate risk to mortgage holders.</br></br>Holders of mortgage securities borrow money to buy those securities. If all goes according to plan, holders buy securities that yield more than they pay on their debt. However, when interest rates fall and homeowners prepay, mortgage holders find that cash flows have changed. What was a nice deal of, say, receiving 6% on mortgages and paying 5% on debt could become a less comfortable arrangement of receiving 5% on mortgages and paying 5% on debt. Not good. Or say that interest rates go up; then homeowners keep their mortgages and holders could find themselves getting 6% on assets but paying 6% on debt. Also not good."
"[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</br></br>Imagine a wave of inflation that sends retailers scrambling to pass on expenses to consumers. What if a retailer tied itself down to constant sales prices?</br></br>Investors could soon find out, as Dollar Tree begins to cope with rising commodity and labor costs. In the past the company, which charges one dollar for everything, benefited from lower costs by offering bigger sizes or higher quality.</br></br>To protect margins, Dollar Tree may now need to try the reverse. In one sense, the company's prices look good enough to withstand some downsizing. Its prices for a group of 50 items such as aspirin are 28% cheaper than Wal-Mart Stores, says Wells Fargo's Matt Nemer.</br></br>Unfortunately, that isn't enough to keep all consumers happy. For items that come in standard sizes like eggs, consumers may not want to buy odd amounts. J.P. Morgan's Charles Grom notes that in a recent inflation cycle the company reduced the size of a string of Christmas lights when they became more expensive, and ultimately stopped selling the product. It also is possible to use lower-quality replacements, but consumers are savvy enough to notice shabby merchandise."

"After decades of rapid growth in which housing developments sprouted in swamps, farmland and deserts, the number of Americans moving to several states in the South and the West has slowed sharply because of the recession and housing bust, according to Census Bureau figures released Wednesday.</br></br>The longtime magnets of Florida and Nevada, which had benefited most as people fled the dreary cold of the Northeast and Midwest, saw more Americans move out than move in during the year that ended July 1.

But they were largely unanimous in urging the president to oppose measures that increase business costs -- such as legislation mandating health benefits -- and to push measures that reduce those costs -- such as limits on product liability suits.</br></br>""I think the most important thing is that we not add to . . . added costs to the society,"" said John Georges, chairman of International Paper Co. ""In other words, we do have a slow-growing economy; we've got to be careful we don't bury it with additional costs, whether they be a whole variety of social, environmental issues."""
"NEW YORK -- Brazil and its major bank creditors are discussing a plan to clear at least some of the more than $3 billion of interest arrears on the country's foreign bank debt, banking sources said.</br></br>The plan, which would require Brazil to commit itself to agreeing with the International Monetary Fund on an economic program, is being sponsored by the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve Board, the sources indicated. It is a last-minute attempt to avert a pending U.S. regulatory decision that could classify banks' Brazilian loans as value-impaired, which would require the banks to write down these credits by 10%. That would mean that the banks would have to take corresponding charges to their capital accounts.</br></br>Under the proposed plan, both Brazil and its banks would pay money into an escrow account at either the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Swiss-based Bank for International Settlements. This money would be used to clear some -- perhaps all -- of the interest arrears, the sources added. The amount that each side would contribute hasn't been decided yet, but banking sources estimate that about two-thirds of any sum would be contributed by the banks. The banks' contribution would be classified as new loans.</br></br>Spokesmen for the Treasury and the Federal Reserve declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Citicorp, which chairs the committee of Brazil's major bank creditors.</br></br>The proposed plan, apparently worked out last week in talks in Washington between Brazil's chief debt negotiator, Fernao Bracher, and Fed and Treasury officials, was discussed at a meeting of Brazil and its bank creditors in New York late yesterday. Mr. Bracher was unavailable for comment."
"In ""Who Speaks for God?"" {op-ed, July 19}, Peter M. Storm presents a tangle of arguments in defense of the ""Christian left"" (a label hurled as a dart by Pat Buchanan, but embraced as a badge by Mr. Storm - shame on both). It would be a lengthy process to untangle the entire yarn, but some points warrant explicit response.</br></br>(1) Mr. Storm writes about ""the Christian right's campaign to impose its agenda on all Americans."" The notion of ""imposing an agenda"" is a curious concept in an arena where citizens or their elected representatives are voting on the issues at hand. Especially since we have the Bill of Rights, I for one am much more comfortable with the right's choice of the democratic process as the field of battle than with the left's choice of the courts to accomplish what it could not do through winning over the minds of the populace.</br></br>(2) ""{O}ne can reasonably ask how a movement that wants the government to decide which books may be in a library ... can also promote itself as in favor of `nonintrusive government.' "" It is government entities, be they federal, state or local, that provide most libraries and schools and are called on to aid U.S. citizens abroad etc. Where else should concerned citizens go to register complaints? (3) ""{R}eligion should inform and prescribe our personal lives, but not our politics."" In this statement, Mr. Storm torpedoes the foundation of American government, which is: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."" I'm glad Mr. Storm was not around in the last century to send the abolitionists staggering home, rebuked by the force of his argument.</br></br>(4) ""{W}ere Jesus alive ..."" Mr. Storm writes. Jesus is alive; surely Mr. Storm must have picked up that much from the book he claims to ""read and love."" This is a substantive, not semantic, point that deserves its own article.</br></br>(5) ""I suspect that God does not care very much about the tax code... . I even suspect that God has a greater agenda than one that would leave room for concerns about the size of the annual U.S., Swedish or Italian budget deficit."" This is as grievous an error in logic as his worry that the Christian right finds divine tax codes in the Bible. The ""omnipotence"" of the God Mr. Storm believes in precludes the notion that any of these human concerns escapes His attention. The point missed by both ""Christian right"" and ""Christian left"" is the division of labor God has laid down. The charge to work for the health and welfare of our fellow humans comes from on high. Establishing the relative roles of public- and private-sector entities in carrying out this charge is for us as free-willed souls to determine in reasoned and courteous debate."
"White House economist Paul W. McCracken, denying an easing of the administration‰Ûªs anti-inflation policy, predicts the general price advance will slow to about 3.5 per cent by the year-end.</br></br>The chairman of the President‰Ûªs Council of Economic Advisers declined to comment on political speculation that the administration urgently wants an upturn in national production before the November elections.</br></br>But the council‰Ûªs January forecast of an expanding economy in the second half of 1970 ‰ÛÏis still a good bet,"" McCracken said in an interview with The Associated Press.</br></br>, His forecast of 3.5 per cent rate of price vise through the economy‰ÛÓnot merely in consumer prices‰ÛÓcompared with a 4.5 per cent advance in the final quarter of 1969.</br></br>Recent spending decisions which endanger President Nixon‰Ûªs planned budget surplus for fiscal 1971 do not signal a basic shift in economic policy, McCracken indicated, but he conceded that the administration may be finding that some of its tight-budget decisions of last January were ‰ÛÏtoo severe"" and may have to be reconsidered."
"NEW YORK, July 28‰ÛÓThe stock market strengthened today in a technical rally led by blue-chip and high-technology issues.</br></br>The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 28.63 to close at 2082.33, erasing a 20-pomt drop in the previous session. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks.</br></br>Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 154.57 million shares, against 135.89 million in the previous session.

"This notion, long a staple of civil rights rhetoric, turns out to be dismayingly accurate. Indeed, according to the lead story in Tuesday‰Ûªs Wall Street Journal, blacks were the only racial group to suffer a net loss of jobs during the 1990-91 recession. Everybody else‰ÛÓwhites, Asians, His-panics, women‰ÛÓgained more jobs than they lost during that period of restructuring, relocation and downsizing.</br></br>In an impressive‰ÛÓand deeply disturbing‰ÛÓpiece of computer-assisted journalism, the Journal analyzed the employment records of 35,242 companies that file reports with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. These companies employ more than 40 million people‰ÛÓabout a third of the national work force‰ÛÓso the findings are of proiound significance.</br></br>Sorting out the causes and cures of the trend may take years of investigation and analysis‰ÛÓno doubt beginning with Congressional Black Caucus Foundation‰Ûªs 23rd annual legislative conference.</br></br>But some things already are clear, including the fact that EEOC filings on ""minority‰Û employment‰ÛÓbecause they include statistics for all minorities and women‰ÛÓtend to hide the specific work force problems of blacks. For instance, Dial Corp., which takes pride in its diversity program, was able to show an impressive increase in ""minority‰Û hiring, thanks to the recruitment of Asian-Americans and American Indians and to the fact that a disproportionately small percentage of white women were laid off. But blacks at Dial lost jobs at a rate two-thirds higher than for the work force as a whole.</br></br>It is also true‰ÛÓthough not discernible from EEOC reports‰ÛÓ that blacks still suffer from racial discrimination, both unconscious and deliberate. Job qualifications unrelated to the actual work to be performed‰ÛÓsubjective assessments of their ability to get along with their co-workers, general but unsubstantiatable notions of their overall competence‰ÛÓall work against blacks at the personnel office. (Test-case experiments involving white and black applicants of identical age and qualification consistently show employers preferring whites.)"
"We recall when ""the energy crisis"" was the centerpiece of received wisdom. The establishment understood the predicament: The weight of the earth was finite, so energy prices had to rise indefinitely. Someday we would look on the shelf and discover there is no more energy. Then we would all freeze in the dark.</br></br>In the last year the establishment has been similarly mesmerized by the predicament of ""a debtor nation"": The American public has such an all-consuming desire for, say, Japanese automobiles that we have to go hat-in-hand to Japan for loans. We are living beyond our means, and have become the world's greatest debtor. Someday we will look on the shelf and find there is no more foreign capital. Then we will all turn into Mexicans.</br></br>This week the Commerce Department released the latest version of the ""debtor nation"" statistics. The ""negative net international investment position"" of the U.S. increased to $236.6 billion in 1986 from $111.9 billion the year before. The wails over this soaring ""debt"" were somewhat diluted, however, because someone noticed that one big reason for the increase was the soaring value of the foreign stake in the U.S. stock market. Can this be all bad?</br></br>It may be an apt moment to talk some sense about both ""debt"" and international statistics generally.</br></br>The absolute first thing to understand is that there is zero chance the U.S. will be faced with the debt problems of Mexico or Brazil. Their problems reached crisis because their debts were denominated in dollars rather than their domestic currencies, and became unmanageable when the dollar rose and their currencies collapsed. The U.S. foreign debt, by contrast, is denominated in dollars. If the dollar collapses, so does the real value of the debt."
"PHILADELPHIA -- When George W. Bush makes a warm-hearted appeal for support across the political spectrum in his acceptance speech tonight, he will sound compassionate. In other words, he'll sound a lot like Bill Clinton.</br></br>But ""compassionate"" is only half of Mr. Bush's ""compassionate conservative"" formula. The ""conservative"" half has gotten far less attention here this week, and yet it forms the bedrock of the strategy that Bush advisers will pursue in search of victory in November.</br></br>The strategy is based on a simple belief: There are more conservatives than liberals in the American electorate, and nearly all of them now are Republicans. That's the legacy Ronald Reagan, who wrenched millions of conservatives from their ancestral Democratic homes, bequeathed to today's GOP. From the beginning of his campaign, Mr. Bush's first priority has been to keep these conservatives content, and that will continue to be the case through the fall run toward the White House.</br></br>Despite much advice to the contrary, candidate Bush has refused to shrink from his conservative positions. He's pushing a sweeping tax-cut plan, even though his congressional counterparts have retreated this year in favor of more modest cuts. He's offering a controversial proposal to partially privatize Social Security that many Republicans in Congress dare not touch. And he's resisting popular gun-control measures, despite fierce Democratic attacks. He also brushed off GOP moderates in selecting a solidly conservative, antiabortion running mate in Dick Cheney. The goal: to nail down the two core elements of a winning coalition, a phalanx of Southern and Western states and white male voters nationwide.</br></br>What's most striking about Mr. Bush's strategy is how it has diverged from the theories that many strategists advanced after the Republicans' electoral setbacks of 1996 and 1998. GOP leaders received plenty of advice to soften their conservative positions on issues such as tax cuts, abortion and gun control, even though such moves would anger the party's base. Mr. Clinton, for his part, used just such an approach to break his party's presidential losing streak in 1992, when he ran as a ""different kind of Democrat"" who pushed welfare and trade policies at odds with the Democrats' black and labor constituencies."
"Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>NEW YORK -- Rumors of a new, lower-priced Macintosh computer drove options traders to Apple Computer on the first day of trading this year.</br></br>Last week, two independent Web sites reported that Apple will introduce a Mac priced below $600 at the MacWorld Conference & Expo to be held in San Francisco next week. One site, Think Secret, predicted that Apple will launch a Mac priced at $499, sans monitor, on Jan. 11.</br></br>Industry observers say the product would be aimed at personal- computer users who want a second computer to use with their iPod, the hand-held digital-music player made by Apple.</br></br>Merrill Lynch analyst Steve Milunovich wrote in a note yesterday that Apple could sell a Mac without a monitor for less than $500 without hurting margins."
"SANTIAGO, Chile -- From the construction cranes dotting the skyline to the modernist paintings decorating the subway, this capital has a thriving air that seems more characteristic of a Scandinavian country than a Latin American one.</br></br>But Chileans won't easily forget the steep price of today's prosperity: the great currency collapse of 1982.</br></br>The implosion of the Chilean peso -- which declined more than 90% in 12 months -- followed an ill-fated effort by a group of U.S.-trained economic officials to peg the currency to the dollar. In the ensuing crisis, one-quarter of Chilean workers lost their jobs, wages regressed to levels not seen in a decade, and soup kitchens provided the only sustenance for millions of the impoverished. Within the depression, however, lay the seeds of Chile's current boom. Forced to look outward for new markets, Chilean companies turned into dynamic exporters, which today sell chopsticks to Japan, wine to Europe and machinery to the U.S.</br></br>Chile's success in transforming a currency bust into an export bonanza underscores a widely overlooked silver lining in the recent Mexican peso crisis: The almost 35% devaluation of the peso could significantly accelerate Mexico's evolution as an export power, a process that was well under way when the country joined the North American Free Trade Agreement. But along with offering hope for Mexico, the story of Chile's painful comeback from devaluation also contains a warning: Mexico will discover that sacrificing near-term domestic wealth for long-term international competitiveness places severe strain on the nation's social fabric.</br></br>""If Mexico's devaluation is to benefit its exports, Mexico must do what Chile did: avoid an inflationary spiral,"" says Sebastian Edwards, chief economist for Latin America at the World Bank. ""That requires sacrifice."""
"The late Sen. Sam Ervin, a great hulk of a man who attained a degree of immortality as the chairman of Capitol Hill's historic Watergate probe, had a wonderful habit. He seldom entered the Senate chamber without bearing a copy of the Constitution on his person, usually a dogeared pamphlet version protruding from a jacket pocket. During his floor speeches he often cited relevant portions of the document spawned by the Founding Fathers.</br></br>Present-day legislators could increase respect for the lawmaking process if they occasionally emulated Ervin's habit. It certainly would have stood the Senate in good stead if one of its members had consulted the Constitution's copyright-patent clauses when S.1264 came up for a vote last month.</br></br>As most bills go, S.1264 -- an amendment to the statute under which the National Endowments of the Arts and Humanities operate -- was on the whole a creditable piece of legislative draftsmanship. Unfortunately, it was marred by a provision the sponsor of the measure, Sen. Dan Quayle (R., Ind.), undoubtedly would have omitted if he had taken into account the Constitution's copyright-patent clause and/or the Supreme Court's decisions on its inherent limitations.</br></br>On its face, the provision in question seems reasonable enough. It merely authorizes preparation of a study to ""determine the feasibility"" of creating ""a revolving fund comprised of payments made to the Federal Government for the right (anyone's right) to use or publicly perform artistic, dramatic, literary, and musical works in the public domain.""</br></br>Merely isn't quite the right word. Judging by what's spelled out in the provision's 12 subsections about the ""scope, direction, and focus"" of the study, it seems to be premised on the curious notion that it's desirable to vest the federal government with control over literally countless words that have become part of the public domain over the years."
"Surging supply and static demand usually don't bode well for bond prices. So why are many analysts pounding the table for muni bonds?</br></br>Falling interest rates and the economy's impressive growth have cleared the way for a torrent of new municipal bonds in the past year. Through Monday, $59.3 billion of new muni bonds were sold this year, up 62% from the $36.7 billion peddled during the year-earlier period, according to Securities Data Co. The amounts exclude securities maturing in less than one year. Issuance last year was $221.4 billion, up from $185 billion in 1996. Both new issues and refundings of previous deals have climbed, and volume should top $240 billion this year. In short, ""the supply has been massive,"" says George Friedlander, Salomon Smith Barney's municipal-bond strategist.</br></br>Meanwhile, the inexorable climb of the stock market and super-slim bond yields have reduced demand from individual investors for muni bonds despite their tax-free status. Although interest has picked up in recent weeks, prices of muni bonds remain low compared with comparable Treasury issues.</br></br>""Munis have certainly done lousy this month, though short- and intermediatebonds have held up OK,"" says William Stevens of Montgomery Asset Management.</br></br>Still, many market participants say munis could represent the best bargains in the bond market. They say new bond issuance should begin to slow in the coming months, due to limitations on how many times issuers can replace outstanding bonds with new bonds. New bond issuance also should slow because many issuers have already come to market in recent months and won't be back again for some time."
"Economists have been predicting that consumers would slow their spending but that the damage would be cushioned as U.S. businesses sold more products abroad. Yesterday, there was evidence that both are starting to happen.</br></br>The U.S. trade deficit fell to $57.6 billion in August, and major retailers' sales at stores open at least a year rose a meager 1.7 percent in September from a year earlier, two reports said yesterday.</br></br>Monthly results can be volatile, and economists caution not to read too much into what could turn out to be blips. But taken together, they are indicators of an economy in transition. The weak housing market is making consumers spend their money more carefully. That in turn means that retailers import fewer goods from abroad, lowering the trade deficit.</br></br>Simultaneously, the slower U.S. economy and lower interest rates mean that the dollar is less valuable compared with other currencies than it was a few months ago. That makes U.S. goods cheaper and exporters more competitive than they have been in recent years, creating a source of growth that will ease the pain of the housing crunch.</br></br>""Trade is providing a pretty big offset to the drag of housing,"" said Brian A. Bethune, an economist with consulting firm Global Insight. ""It's not totally offsetting housing, but it is a buffer."""

"NEW YORK -- In its third acquisition in two weeks, GT Interactive Software Corp. purchased Humongous Entertainment Inc., one of the country's leading children's software publishers, for stock valued at $76 million.</br></br>The sale, which closed yesterday, involved the exchange of four million shares of GT Interactive stock valued $19 each, for all of Humongous's closely held stock. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, GT's shares fell 50 cents to close at $19.</br></br>GT's move comes as the CD-ROM industry churns out more titles than retailers can promote and market. Andrew Gregor, senior vice president of GT Interactive, said he expects the industry to go through a major consolidation period, one that will result in six or seven major companies dominating at least 80% of the industry within a few years.</br></br>""The model is the record or film studio business,"" said Mr. Gregor. ""Content will always be very important, but there is a lot of content out there. What distinguishes a successful company is the ability to distribute product."" Mr. Gregor estimated there are more than 15,000 CD-ROM titles for sale today, although the average mass merchant has room to stock 300.</br></br>GT Interactive, which went public last December, made its mark in the multimedia field as the distributor of Doom, one of the country's most successful CD-ROM action titles. Since then, the company has established itself as a software publisher, primarily of entertainment games created by other companies."
"NEW YORK -- Currency traders took their cue again from falling U.S. stock and bond markets and sold the dollar against most major currencies.</br></br>Analysts cited Wall Street Journal articles which fanned fears that foreign investors and U.S. mutual funds might cut back on the huge amount of money they've put into U.S. asset markets.</br></br>Also, early in Asian trading Wednesday, the Australian dollar dove immediately after the Reserve Bank of Australia surprised markets by cutting the key cash rate to 6% from 6.5%, citing an improved inflation outlook and a strengthening currency. After its initial fall, the Australian dollar stabilized just above 79 (U.S.) cents for the rest of the global trading day.</br></br>Traders sold U.S. dollars in Asia and Europe, reflecting worries that U.S. stock markets would open with a plunge. When prices did indeed fall sharply in early New York Stock Exchange trading, New York traders continued to sell the U.S. dollar. By the end of the global trading day, it was down more than one pfennig and almost half a yen.</br></br>The suggestions that investors might pull away from U.S. assets coincide with ""fear [that stocks] are flying"" too high, said David Munro, economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. But with a strong U.S. economy, ""it's hard to make much of a case for a depreciation or loss in the dollar,"" he said."

"Sharp increases in the cost of clothing and auto insurance helped send inflation back into the 5 percent annual range last month despite the smallest monthly increase in food costs since February, the government said yesterday.</br></br>Consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in October‰ÛÓor at an annual rate of 5.1 percent‰ÛÓwith more than half of the gain coming from a 1.8 percent boost in apparel prices and steep increases in auto insurance and financing charges, the Labor Department said.</br></br>1.7	percent drop in gasoline prices offset drought-caused spikes in grocery prices.

"In all the hundreds of books, articles and speeches on American competitiveness -- or the lack thereof -- work rules and job restrictions are rarely mentioned. Such rules forbid a foreman to do any production work, whether taking the place of a worker who goes to the restroom, repairing a tool or helping when the work falls behind. They forbid electricians to straighten a stud when installing a fuse box. They forbid workers' moving from one job to another, thus restricting them to narrow, repetitive tasks, e.g. spray-painting the door panel of a car. And they narrowly restrict what a worker may be trained for. Yet all available evidence indicates that work rules and job restrictions are the main cause of the ""productivity gap"" of American (and European) manufacturing industry.</br></br>To be sure, productivity is not the sum of competitiveness. But when it comes to making things, productivity is the foundation. And it is precisely those American and European industries in which making things is most hedged in by work rules and job restrictions -- steel, automobiles, consumer electronics, rubber and so on -- that have done the poorest against the competitors from East Asia.</br></br>The best evidence for the effect of work rules and job restrictions is found in America's building industry. It alone of all major industries anywhere has -- working side by side -- union shops with tight job restrictions and non-union shops without them. Both shops are often owned by the same company -- it's called ""double-breasting"" in the industry -- with the same people running them. The time it takes to do an individual job, e.g. connecting a drain pipe, is exactly the same in both. Yet the crew working under work rules and job restrictions needs two-thirds more people to do the same job in the same time.</br></br>A ""double-breasted"" contractor recently ran a study on two nearly identical projects done by his company, one by a union crew, the other by a non-union crew. The non-union crew worked an average of 50 minutes out of every hour. The union crew worked 35; the rest of the time it was forced to wait -- for someone to come back from the restroom or for a journeyman to become available to do work an apprentice could easily have done but was not allowed to touch. The unionized crew also had to work short-handed for 40 minutes until a man qualified to drive a truck had come back from the shop with a replacement part. When that happened on the non-union project, the foreman ran the errand and the work continued.</br></br>The result: The unionized crew required a crew of eight, the non-union job was done by five workers. Interestingly, the large Japanese contractors who are considered models of efficiency work with roughly the same productivity, all observers agree, as American non-union contractors."
"The U.S. Treasury yesterday sold $11 billion worth of 30-year bonds for an average yield of 6.43 percent, more than two-tenths of a percentage point higher than they were late last month before the Federal Reserve raised short-term term rates in a precautionary move against inflation.</br></br>The continued rise in long-term rates helped undermine stock prices yesterday as the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 36.58 points to close at 3895.34.</br></br>At that level, the average has recovered only about one-fourth of the 96-point loss it suffered a week ago when the Fed announced its decision to raise short-term rates by a quarter of a percentage point.</br></br>The Fed and the Clinton administration had hoped long-term rates would rise little if at all following the central bank's action. Most economists believe long-term rates have more of an impact on the economy than short-term rates because they affect investment decisions such as whether to buy a home or new equipment for a business.</br></br>This week's quarterly Treasury auction of notes and bonds probably has caused rates to be firmer than they otherwise would be, leaving analysts to say yesterday that it is still too early to judge whether long-term rates will keep their gains."
"The way everyone's carrying on about the 1984 U.S. merchandise trade deficit you'd think a flying saucer had landed and threatened to spray us all with poison gas. The National Association of Manufacturers is calling the record $123.3 billion deficit a ""disaster."" Rep. Don Bonker (D., Wash.) naturally thinks the Reagan administration needs to be ""held accountable.""</br></br>Presidents need to be held accountable for things they should control, but the president, thank goodness, does not dictate how much Americans buy and sell abroad. Even if he did, he would find it extremely hard to kill the trade deficit his critics think so horrendous without at the same time aborting the U.S. economic recovery.</br></br>As every dime-store clerk knows, 1984 was anything but an economic ""disaster"" for the U.S. The trade deficit stems from the fact that, with a few sectoral exceptions, the U.S. economy came roaring back from recession with immense vigor. When demand booms, it sucks in goods of all kinds. U.S. industries give exporting a lower priority as they rush to meet domestic demand. U.S. trade will move toward balance when the U.S. economic growth rate falls more into line with the average growth rate of U.S. trading partners. You will know this is happening when those who are currently viewing the trade deficit with alarm start complaining that America is falling behind in the world.</br></br>This is not to say that politicians cannot affect trade. They certainly can and they do, almost always for the worse. A good Ph.D. thesis could be written about the damage Washington did to the world competitive position of the U.S. auto industry in the 1970s with misguided overregulation, best represented by fuel-efficiency standards that disrupted the industry's product planning and opened the import door to foreign luxury cars.</br></br>That is why we are always wary when politicians and industry lobbies start yelling ""disaster."" When the subject is trade, the next word that comes after ""disaster"" is ""protection."" If the U.S. wants economic trouble, that's the way to get it."
"RIO DE JANEIRO -- One of the major triumphs of Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's first year in office was coordinating a coherent economic policy from a highly diverse team, including former leftist radicals, industrialists and an ex-banker.</br></br>But in year two of Mr. da Silva's tenure, notes of discord within the administration are becoming increasingly evident, rattling markets at a delicate moment: The U.S. Federal Reserve has signaled an interest-rate policy shift that is creating a less favorable backdrop for emerging markets.</br></br>Brazil's policy makers recently have issued conflicting statements on interest-rate policy, the extension of an Amazon free-trade zone, a public-sector hiring program and other matters. On Wednesday, Central Bank President Henrique Meirelles, a former FleetBoston Financial Corp. banker who has faced sniping from elsewhere in the government over his hawkish anti-inflationary stance, felt compelled to publicly address rumors of his impending resignation, which he dismissed as ""nonsense.""</br></br>Mario Mesquita, chief economist at ABN AMRO Brazil, wrote yesterday that ""the buildup in political noise surrounding economic policy and key policy makers seems to be getting out of hand.""</br></br>One camp within the government, which has held sway until now, emphasizes eradicating inflation to please financial markets; the other camp, which is becoming more vocal with municipal elections scheduled later this year, puts greater emphasis on priming growth to more quickly satisfy Brazilian workers."
"WASHINGTON -- With signs that the job market is softening only a bit, consumer confidence remains high heading into the holiday shopping season, giving beleaguered retailers a reason to cheer.</br></br>The Labor Department said the number of first-time claims for jobless benefits climbed by an unexpectedly large 7,000 last week while a longer-term gauge hit its highest level in nearly two years. The numbers suggest that the jobless rate will increase in coming months.</br></br>Still, the unemployment picture has yet to take a bite out of consumer's confidence in the economy. The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment actually increased in November, surprising analysts expecting a decline due to stock-market weakness and continuing election uncertainty. The index finished the month at 107.6, nearly two points higher than its 105.8 level in October and only a few points below the record set in January.</br></br>The report offered a burst of good news for the nation's retailers, who have seen their stock prices battered in recent weeks amid evidence of slackening sales and dire predictions for a relatively weak holiday-shopping season. Most retailers' fortunes rest on the crowds of shoppers who flock to their stores between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day.</br></br>The new data suggest that such fears may be groundless. ""With the index at these levels, it would still be reasonable to expect robust growth in consumer spending,"" said Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist of High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y."
"Two candidates for the Senate in the Virginia Democratic primary on July 15 gave their opinions on how to control inflation when they answered a questionnaire prepared by the League of Women Voters of the State.</br></br>The League yesterday released the responses Sen.

"Americans quickly come to think of pleasures as entitlements, so as the gaudy economic expansion encounters turbulence, they seem not just stunned but affronted. The stock market, however, is simply doing its job, reallocating capital from unproductive to more productive uses. This is, so far, what a soft landing of a high- flying economy looks like. And the vocal angst of many investors is what a soft landing sounds like in a spoiled nation that is becoming the crybaby of the Western world.</br></br>Economic expansions are not like human beings and light bulbs. Expansions do not inevitably expire of natural causes. They could continue indefinitely, absent policy blunders by government or major mistakes by sizable elements of the private sector. The latter sort of mistakes have been made, particularly in overinvestment in technology and dot-com sectors. But government has two powerful levers for moving the faltering economy--interest rates, which are high, and fiscal policy, which is tight because government is running a surplus. Interest rates and taxes can be lowered.</br></br>Anyway, America's long expansion may not be over. Housing starts are up, the job market remains strong, and some producers' difficulties are consumers' delights: AT&T has cut its dividend for the first time in 113 years, and its stock is down 60 percent, but, then, long distance rates have fallen 35 percent in seven years, and cell phone rates even faster--in effect, a huge transfer of wealth from producers to consumers of those services.</br></br>Third-quarter growth (2.4 percent) was less than half the second- quarter rate (5.6), and sobering economic indicators have been multiplying for many months. Sobriety--a virtue, lest we forget--was producing dot-com carnage last spring. Investors were at long last pulling back from valuing companies for prospects--often chimerical-- rather than profits, and were belatedly acknowledging that, ultimately, profits dictate share prices.</br></br>On Oct. 12, in a sell-off unrelated to technology, the Dow began falling 379.21 points (3.6 percent) minutes after Home Depot, one of Wall Street's top growth stocks and a bellwether of consumer spending, warned that third-quarter earnings would fall short of analysts' expectations. Home Depot's stock plunged 28 percent because the firm's growth was 4 rather than 7 percent. But 4 percent is hardly agony. Besides, the analysts who set expectations sell stocks- -so they sell expectations. Furthermore, Home Depot ascribed its disappointment to the happy fact, for consumers, of falling prices of some building products. For example, during the summer, when housing starts slowed, sawmills did not, so lumber prices fell."
"The pending farm bill provides no parity for the poor. Faced with the need to cut the federal deficit and deal with falling farm income, Congress is pursuing the easiest and least defensible solution. It‰Ûªs asking American consumers to pay more for food, and the burden will fall disproportionately on the poor and hungry. In 1981 and 1982, Congress cut over $3 billion from food assistance programs. Now it is voting to raise supermarket prices for milk, cheese, meat and bread.</br></br>For almost 50 years the federal government has attempted to increase farm income through a combination of programs that limit production and drive food prices up or that make direct payments to farmers when farm prices fall below a certain level. Direct payments tend to have less impact on retail food prices, but they can cost the taxpayer a lot of money. Therefore, it isn‰Ûªt surprising that, in a time of huge budget deficits, a growing farm crisis and relatively stable food prices. Congress is tempted to adopt a farm program that shifts costs from the citizen as taxpayer to the citizen as consumer.</br></br>The House has already succumbed. It approved a dairy diversion program that will raise millc and cheese prices by $10 billion over the next four years and a sugar program that will cost consumers $140 million to $160 million a year. It is about to vote on a program of mandatory production controls on feed grains and wheat that would raise meat and bakery product prices by $15 billion over a four-year period and could raise the consumer price index for food by 1 percent a year.</br></br>Production-control advocates argue that food prices have been quite stable over the past few years, that Americans spend less of their disposable income for food than consumers in other developed nations and that the anticipated food-price increases generated by the farm bill are a reasonable trade-off for preserving the family farm.</br></br>They aren‰Ûªt all wrong. Food prices went up 4 percent last year, and this year‰Ûªs increase is expected to be about the same. Our food prices are generally lower than those in other countries. I believe urban America has a stake in maintaining a healthy farm economy."
"Idec Pharmaceuticals Corp. and Biogen Inc. announced yesterday that they would merge in a $6.8 billion deal that will create a powerhouse in the biotechnology industry, with the new company earning profits from two of the biggest biotech drugs on the market.</br></br>It's the second-biggest biotech merger ever, after Amgen Inc.'s $10.8 billion acquisition of Immunex Corp. in 2002.</br></br>To some degree, the deal reflects the extraordinary dependence of even the largest biotech companies on a handful of products. Stock valuations of both Biogen and Idec were driven by a single blockbuster drug for each company, and sales growth for those drugs had leveled off recently. The companies had no immediate prospects for delivering the earnings growth that Wall Street is demanding of top-tier biotech companies.</br></br>""Neither company has a great pipeline,"" said John McCamant, editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter in Berkeley, Calif., using the industry term for a portfolio of experimental drugs. ""Both companies see an opportunity to leapfrog some of the competition and become the clear No. 3 biotech.""</br></br>The companies' managements emphasized, however, that the long- range future of their combined organization will be bright. The merged company will have strengths in some of the hottest areas in medicine these days, with particular focus on cancer treatment and on the many serious diseases that involve overactivation of the immune system."
"The nation's output of goods and services, squeezed by persistently high interest rates, fell at a 1.9 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate in the second quarter, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. -.; 1</br></br>The inflation rate also dropped sharply from a 9.8 percent annual rate in the first quarter to only 6 percent-in the second, the department said. Food and energy prices rose much less rapidly than in the first quarter. With economic activity essentially flat since January and the high level of interest rates helping to push down many sensitive commodity prices, the rate of inflation as mea.-sured by the GNP deflator was at its lowest level in three years.</br></br>- Most forecasters, including those in the Reagan administration, expect no pickup in the economy until late this year or early in 1982, and some believe the second quarter was the opening phase of what would be the nation‰Ûªs second recession in two years.</br></br>In updating its forecast last week in connection with the midyear budget review, the administration declared, ‰ÛÏLittle or no real output growth is expected during the remainder of the year.‰Û</br></br>Also as part of that forecast, the Reagan economists predicted that the unemployment rate, which was -7.3 percent in June, would average 7.7 percent in the fourth quarter."
"The subtitle of Bubble Man symbolizes the many flaws in Peter Hartcher's jeremiad against Alan Greenspan and the dot-com hysteria that the former Federal Reserve chairman allegedly abetted. The ""Missing 7 Trillion Dollars"" refers to the losses that stockholders incurred in the three years after the late-1990s stock market bubble collapsed. Throughout the book, Hartcher argues that Greenspan is to blame for those losses -- until the epilogue, in which Hartcher acknowledges that in the three years after those three years, a market upswing recovered ""nine dollars out of every ten lost."" As Gilda Radner's Emily Litella famously put it, ""Never mind.""</br></br>Bubble Man's thesis is simple and direct: From 1996 on, Greenspan knew that equity markets were overheated and should have taken concerted action to cool them. In fact, he gave one speech in December of that year questioning the ""irrational exuberance"" of investors but never followed up to pop the bubble. Indeed, by 1999, Greenspan had become an out-and-out cheerleader of the so-called New Economy, in which labor productivity was rising so quickly that inflationary pressures were of minimal concern. As the steward of America's financial markets, he should have known better, Hartcher argues, but in the face of jawboning from both Congress and the White House, Greenspan buckled under and took the easy way out.</br></br>Hartcher's evidence for most of these assertions is a pretty thin gruel. In the transcript of a September 1996 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, Greenspan says that he thought stocks were experiencing a bubble market. Hartcher -- the former Washington bureau chief of the Australian Financial Review, now political editor of the Sydney Morning Herald -- takes this as ironclad evidence that Greenspan knew that something was rotten in the state of Wall Street but chose to do nothing.</br></br>The problem is that Bubble Man assumes that, at the moment Greenspan uttered that sentence, his opinion was both fixed and true. Neither assertion holds up. Hartcher fails to demonstrate that Greenspan ever repeated his comment at any later Fed meeting. The record suggests that Greenspan was worried about asset-price inflation -- that is, skyrocketing stock and housing prices. Furthermore, he was not entirely sure he should be worried about it. As the 1990s progressed, he continually sought out diverse views on this point. The fact that his infamous caution against ""irrational exuberance"" was framed as a question symbolizes the extent of his uncertainty.</br></br>As it turns out, Greenspan was right to be unsure. For all the talk about stock market bubbles, the returns on tech stocks in the decade since 1996 have proven way higher than the historical average. Price-to-earnings ratios are now higher than the historical average, albeit significantly lower than they were at the peak of the dot-com era. When one takes a step back, Hartcher's case falls apart completely. To assert that Greenspan's Fed was the primary regulatory authority responsible for the dot-com bubble requires the reader to swallow an awful lot. For one thing, you need to accept that other government agencies -- say, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Treasury Department -- should be completely exonerated for their roles in the mishap; for another, you need to accept that the Fed would somehow be able to deflate stock prices without harming the real economy."
"A ‰ÛÏvery large‰Û increase in prices by the oil cartel at its meeting next month would ‰ÛÏundermine‰Û prospects for ‰ÛÏreaching an orderly economic adjustment and a fairly prompt turnaround of the inflationary situation‰Û in the United States, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A.

"ROSWELL, Ga. -- The waiting list for subsidized housing here, just 40 families long a year ago, is up to 500. The number of children eligible for free or reduced lunch is up 50%. A little more than a year ago, the Methodist church began seminars for marriages strained by job losses.</br></br>Roswell is a pre-Civil War cotton mill town that grew into a wealthy bedroom community of Atlanta as the metro area prospered. More than half the city's 88,000 residents have four-year college degrees. But Roswell sits in a region with an unusually severe case of long-term unemployment: About 40% of the unemployed in the Atlanta metro area in 2010, the most recent local data available, were out of work for a year or more versus the national average of 29%.</br></br>One of them is Marcy Bronner, 57 years old. When she lost her job at Pennzoil back in 2000, it took her seven months to find a new one at Quintiles, a bio- and pharmaceutical-services company. She eventually became senior director of human resources at a salary in the low six figures.</br></br>In November 2010, she was laid off again. More than a year later, she is still looking for work. ""It's harder now,"" she says, compared to the 2000s. ""There's a lot more people out there.""</br></br>While the job market is improving -- the national unemployment rate fell to 8.5% in December -- long-term unemployment continues to be particularly pronounced, and there is little indication that it is falling quickly.

Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has called this ""a national crisis."""
"Gold's glittering rise came to an abrupt halt on Wednesday as investors piled out of the metal, driving prices down 5.6%.</br></br>The decline lopped $104.20 off the price of a troy ounce, pushing it down to $1,754.10. It marked a dramatic reversal after weeks of gains.</br></br>The slump began in early trading and selling accelerated quickly as volume spiked. Ominously, in some people's opinions, the move came amid little obviously negative news.

"Washingtonians headed south this month, beware. The long, hot season of traffic congestion around Colonial Williamsburg and Busch Gardens is in full swing. This year's tie-up has an interesting twist. A new Busch Gardens exit, including a bridge over Interstate 64, was supposed to open this summer but the project is a full year behind schedule. The exit will benefit tourists and residents by redirecting traffic from clogged roads. The Virginia Department of Transportation explains that its contractor faces a severe shortage of U.S.-made steel for the project.</br></br>Federal ""Buy American"" laws forbid interstate highway projects with federal financing from using imported steel, even if there is no domestic steel available. The restrictions apply equally to the raw material (rolled beam) or the fabricated product (finished girders). A Northern Virginia contractor with whom I spoke said his supplier could use imported rolled beam for the contractor's private projects, but for federal roads projects such as the Interstate 95 exchange at Springfield, the domestic raw material costing 15 to 30 percent more was required. By expensively micromanaging his projects, his firm has steel. Others are scrambling. Guess who ultimately pays the extra cost.</br></br>Buy American policies are nothing new, and they have a patriotic plausibility to most people. Who could be against saving American jobs? In many circumstances they are also innocuous. On the other hand, if they squeeze out imports as intended, they maintain higher prices to American steel users or cause them production delays waiting for backlogged orders to clear. This may save some jobs in favored industries like steel, but at a cost of sales and jobs in American industries that use steel. The benefits this policy provides to the protected steel workers and shareholders come directly out of the pockets of other Americans. This is income redistribution of the worst sort--from average folks to a group that earns substantially more than the manufacturing mean wage. In times of high unemployment, Buy American provisions conceivably can raise domestic demand, thus cushioning a cyclical downturn. But these discriminatory policies are hopelessly inefficient compared with Alan Greenspan's well-oiled monetary policy machine. By the way, has anyone checked the unemployment rate lately?</br></br>What many people do not realize is that the most intense competition American firms face is not with foreign firms but with other American firms in markets for talented labor and scarce capital. Any policy that favors one set of American industries disfavors others. The most important possible exception to this is for policies that are designed to enhance innovation in ways that spill over to other American firms. Buy American policies are not directed toward research and development, and the steel industry is not at the cutting edge of technical progress.</br></br>Highway construction contractors happily use Komatsu earth-moving equipment and a host of other imported products. So why is USX favored and Caterpillar not? The answer, of course, is lobbying power. A large industry spread across a number of important states often gets its way. Alas for the steel industry, its influence isn't what it used to be. The industry employs more than 400,000 fewer workers than it did in 1960. Small, modern mini-mills now provide almost half of domestic output. They have production costs substantially lower than the remaining large-scale integrated mills for which steel protectionism was designed."

"-- A U.N.-appointed panel investigating influence peddling in the oil-for-food program in Iraq is examining three contacts between Secretary General Kofi Annan and executives of a Swiss company that made payments to Annan's son while it conducted millions of dollars' worth of business with the world body, a senior U.N. official said.</br></br>The U.N. chief of staff, Mark Malloch Brown, made the disclosure less than a week before former Federal Reserve chairman Paul A. Volcker is due to issue a report on whether Kojo Annan improperly used his family connections to obtain a U.N. contract for his former employer, Cotecna Inspection SA, in December 1998.</br></br>Malloch Brown described Annan's meetings as ""innocent encounters"" that played no role in securing contracts for the Geneva-based firm and said the secretary general told investigators about them. He said that Annan is confident he ""will be exonerated of any wrongdoing"" but that Volcker will determine whether the actions of his son were ""appropriate or not.""</br></br>The $64 billion U.N. oil-for-food program was created in December 1996 to provide Iraq with an exemption from sanctions, which had been imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, to sell oil to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian goods. The former Iraqi government collected more than $2 billion in bribes and kickbacks from companies trading with Iraq under the program.</br></br>Annan appointed Volcker in April to investigate allegations of misconduct by U.N. personnel. Last month, Volcker accused Benon Sevan, the former director of the oil-for-food program, of asking the Iraqi government to steer valuable oil contracts to an Egyptian businessman.

"WASHINGTON -- The government's report that the merchandise-trade deficit narrowed to $13.22 billion in November indicates that the improving trade picture is finally starting to be reflected in the monthly figures.</br></br>The deficit for 1987 is still likely to set a record of more than $170 billion, however, and analysts cautioned against expecting further substantial gains in coming months.</br></br>But the November gap was much smaller than October's record $17.63 billion, which rocked financial markets, sending the dollar plunging against foreign currencies.

But until the latest report, little improvement has been apparent in the volatile monthly figures, which aren't adjusted for seasonal variation or inflation.</br></br>The November deficit was the smallest since a $12.96 billion gap in April.

"WASHINGTON -- Some of the most popular provisions in President Bush's tax-cut package could get whittled down as Senate Republicans try to make room for the White House's top priority: repealing the tax that individuals pay on corporate dividends.</br></br>One benefit in Mr. Bush's proposal would boost the child tax credit to $1,000 from the current $600.

The annual cap today is $25,000; under Mr. Bush's proposal, it would immediately rise to $75,000, carrying an estimated cost of about $29 billion over the next 10 years. Republicans are eyeing cheaper options, such as only doubling the cap and letting it to expire after a few years.</br></br>The changes are necessary if the Senate is to stay within its budget limit of a $350 billion, 10-year tax-cut package. If tax writers can find ways to offset extra costs, the final figure could grow to $400 billion.</br></br>Despite the $350 billion lid -- set by Republican moderates who worry about the ballooning federal deficit -- Mr. Bush wants Congress to approve the dividend-tax repeal that is the centerpiece of his economic-growth plan. That package, unveiled in January, has a 10-year price tag of $725 billion, more than half for dividend-tax relief."
"Tuition costs at public colleges rose more rapidly last year than at any time over the past three decades, according to a report released yesterday. After adjusting for inflation, costs were up 13 percent for the year and 47 percent for the past decade.</br></br>The annual report by the College Board, which collects data from more than 4,000 institutions, said tuition and fees also rose substantially last year at private colleges and universities, but at a slower rate than in the public sector. If room and board costs are included, the average student now pays $26,854 a year to attend a private university, and $10,636 to attend a public university in his or her own state.</br></br>""College tuition and fees are getting out of control, and we need to do something about it,"" said Rep. Howard P. ""Buck"" McKeon (R- Calif.) who has proposed legislation that would penalize institutions that ""repeatedly engage in exorbitant tuition hikes.""</br></br>According to the College Board, the 13 percent real increase in tuition at public colleges last year was ""the highest in at least three decades."" It followed an inflation-adjusted increase of 8 percent the previous year, ""a growth rate that had not been seen for 20 years.""</br></br>The College Board survey suggests that the rise of tuition costs has been particularly rapid in mid-Atlantic and midwestern states, as universities scramble to plug deficits caused by declining state appropriations. The University of Maryland increased its prices by 21 percent last year and has proposed an 11 percent increase for next year. Costs at the University of Virginia are nearly 30 percent higher than they were last fall."
"Your editorial ""The Bush Economy"" (Jan. 17) states ""Democrats like to claim the 1990s were a golden age while the Bush years have been disastrous."" For the Clinton years, their claim is accurate.</br></br>The average annual growth rate of real GDP during Bill Clinton's presidency was 3.7%. The average annual growth rate of real GDP during the first seven years of George W. Bush's presidency was just 2.3%. When the growth rate for 2008 is announced, the average annual growth rate of real GDP for Mr. Bush's eight years in office will be less than 2%.</br></br>Bill Clinton presided over a huge expansion in private-sector employment during his eight years in office: Payrolls increased by 21.14 million. Private-sector payrolls have increased by just 1.3 million under Mr. Bush. In other words, for every 16 private-sector payroll jobs created while Bill Clinton was in office, President Bush has overseen the creation of just one private-sector payroll job. To say the least, that is a significant difference, especially when one considers that Mr. Clinton raised tax rates and Mr. Bush reduced them.</br></br>The robust economic and private-sector employment growth during the Clinton years was also reflected in the stock market. The S&P 500 index stood at 435.71 at the end of 1992. Eight years later it was 1,320.28, an increase of 884.57 points or 203%. At the end of 2008 the S&P 500 index stood at 903.25, declining 417.03 points or 31.6% over eight years.</br></br>There is one area where George W. Bush easily surpassed Bill Clinton: the growth in federal spending. From the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 2000 the annual rate of federal spending increased by $421.6 billion. By the third quarter of 2008 the annual rate of federal spending was running higher by another $1.244 billion."

This fueled decent demand for the afternoon's $42 billion five-year note sale, the second leg of this week's $118 billion Treasury note supply.</br></br>An unexpected drop in U.S. new-home sales spurred many investors to seek comfort in low-risk U.S. government debt, pushing yields on some Treasury securities maturing in a month, known as one-month T-bills, slightly below zero. Such securities are sold initially at a discount, so a negative yield means some investors are willing to buy the bills while forsaking the chances of earning interest.</br></br>But the market flipped in afternoon trade, the selling driven by Kansas City Fed President Thomas Hoenig's vote against the central bank's decision to keep the main policy rate near zero.

"It was a tough year on Wall Street. The Super Bowl theory got beat up pretty badly.</br></br>Ever since football's clash of the titans began in 1967, the Super Bowl theory has boasted a record for clairvoyance unmatched by any technical analyst, Ph.D. economist or money manager with a six-figure income. Every year the National Football Conference team won, the stock market -- as measured by the New York Stock Exchange composite index -- rose. Every year the American Football Conference team won, the market lost ground.</br></br>Last year, however, the AFC's Los Angeles Raiders won, and the New York composite unobligingly rose. The rise was only 1.26%, to be sure, but an indicator's an indicator, after all.</br></br>The Super Bowl theory wasn't the only harebrained indicator of market performance that had a tough year.

"Mayor Marion Barry declared a new era yesterday of cooperation with the D.C. financial control board, submitting a revised 1997 budget that makes numerous changes the board had sought and cuts the city's projected budget deficit for the year nearly in half.</br></br>Barry's conciliatory gestures come just days after he and board Chairman Andrew F.

"From coast to coast, governors are tiptoeing around gaping deficits in state budgets. They have appeared suddenly, like sinkholes in tapped-out oil fields: $12.5 billion in California, $1.4 billion in Michigan, $533 million in Kentucky. These shortfalls are small by federal standards. But unlike the government in Washington, state governments must balance their budgets every year: Virtually all are forbidden, by law or constitution, from running deficits. As a result, 40 states must close a collective $40 billion in deficits for fiscal 2002, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers.</br></br>But this being an election year, the story doesn't end there. From Hartford to Sacramento, these gaps are generating significant political tension. Virtually every state chief executive has ruled out the most potent revenue-raising weapon in his or her arsenal: income tax increases. And that's a mistake. Governors are turning their backs on the most ready source of revenues -- as well as the fairest and most painless way of raising funds.</br></br>It wasn't always this way. During the last recession, in the early 1990s, governors and big city mayors faced much the same challenge. Many of them, Democrats and Republicans alike, took what seemed to be the easy route. They simply cut spending and pushed through income tax hikes. Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton pursued essentially the same strategy, boosting marginal income tax rates on the highest-earning Americans.</br></br>But while the income tax increases of a decade ago proved to be solid fiscal successes, they were abject political failures. And as a result, today's governors treat income tax increases the way members of the Texas congressional delegation treat Enron. They shudder even to mention the powerful force that until recently provided them with immense benefits even though, from a fiscal perspective, it makes the most sense to tax the richest vein of revenues.</br></br>Never mind the hoary debate over regressive sales taxes and progressive taxes on income. Raising taxes on income simply doesn't enter the vocabulary of today's governors, regardless of their party. Instead, today's fiscally challenged governors are earnestly pledging to cut spending, commandeering funds from the tobacco settlement, and placing big bets on two fiscal long-shots: a swift economic recovery and increased federal aid. Those who are raising revenues are embracing less politically painful -- and likely less effective -- taxes on cigarettes, telephones, sales and services."
"President Clinton and his allies in Congress are calling for another increase in the minimum wage. But they should consider the experience of small-business owners like me, who struggled through the last increase. I own and manage a small cafe. I have had as many as 16 employees; I now have nine. Most of them are teenagers; the rest, working mothers.</br></br>Before the last increase I wrote letters to the president and my congressmen. I explained that the mandated wage increase was only the tip of the iceberg. To maintain the wage increment for senior employees, I would have to raise their wages above the new minimum. My monthly payroll would increase by $570 -- and that didn't include the payroll taxes for Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance and workman's compensation. For my efforts I received nicely worded form letters about the benefits of the wage increase.</br></br>When the increase passed, I had to reduce staffing hours. Result: I am working harder to earn my money. I already worked six days a week, every week. The staffing cutbacks increased my workload by 15 hours a week. I also cut back on outside services, so I am now mopping my own floors two weeks each month and doing all my own accounting, the weekly laundry and as many of the repairs as I can.</br></br>When Mr. Clinton signed the wage increase into law, he had by his side a minimum-wage worker who stated that now she did not have to choose between paying her electric bill or her gas bill. The same evening, our local news interviewed a woman who said she would now be able to buy her daughter a compact disk player for graduation. I do not begrudge either of these women their good fortune. But business owners work hard too, and we also have to make tough choices. I suffer from several chronic illnesses, and the wage increase has forced me to cut back on medical care.</br></br>Money for minimum wage increases has to come from somewhere. Mr. Clinton's proposed increase would raise my annual payroll by $7,200, forcing me to close my doors. To the politicians I say this: You have the power to destroy the American Dream for thousands of small-business owners. If you pass another increase in the minimum wage, you can tell the teenagers and working mothers I employ why they no longer have jobs. Then try asking for their votes."

"If there were such a thing as a hospice for software, WordPerfect would have checked in a long time ago. Its fall from the summit to the cellar of the productivity-software market has few parallels in the business. But the program -- owned by Corel since 1996 and now sold mostly as part of an office suite -- has soldiered on. In the past two years it's even gained ground, thanks to aggressive bundling deals that put it on the hard drives of computers from Dell, Gateway, Hewlett-Packard and Sony.</br></br>The new WordPerfect Office 11, however, isn't about to win any more converts.

But down here, concern over the country's financial follies runs a poor second to everyday events in this elegant capital.</br></br>Argentina just doesn't look like a place in hock for billions of dollars. Women window-shop along the broad avenues, wrapped in furs to ward off the South American winter. The stores are stuffed with fine leather goods, designer fashions, glistening silver. Aerobics centers have waiting lists.</br></br>In an exclusive leather shop on Florida Street, a young man is buying two wallets -- very chic, very expensive. His explanation for all the high living in the midst of a huge debt crisis? ""I don't feel the foreign debt, I feel 600% (annual) inflation,"" he says, slapping several million-peso notes on the counter. ""Our money is worth less every day, so why not spend now? Things will only be more expensive tomorrow."""
"Inside a school gym in Smithers, W.Va., Mormon missionaries were giving out used clothing to poor families. Inside the town's senior center, volunteers ladled free lunches to the indigent elderly while cartons of surplus butter, flour, pork and peanut butter were lined up for distribution to the unemployed the next day. Inside his police car, though, Eddie A. Long, the mayor of Smithers, was smiling. He was driving me to see the thing that was going to save his depressed little city, maybe even make it flourish.</br></br>But first he took me on a tour of town. It didn't take long. The downtown area is only a couple of streets. There's a TV repair shop, a dance studio, a Christian bookstore, a movie rental place and a few other shops, some of them boarded up. Plus eight churches and seven bars.</br></br>""Smithers used to be a booming town back in the '40s and '50s,"" the mayor said. A retired meat cutter, Long, 59, wore a blue baseball cap over his gray hair and puffed on a cigarette as he drove. ""We had two theaters, two or three grocery stores, a bowling alley - and of course beer joints,"" he said with a grin. ""They'll always be here.""</br></br>Back in its heyday, Smithers was a thriving coal town with more than 3,000 residents. But now, Long said, ""the coal mines is played out around here"" and the population has dwindled to maybe 2,000 - more than two-thirds of them, he estimates, either retired or unemployed.</br></br>""They'll walk the streets, come in and see if I got anything for 'em,"" Long said, driving the police car slowly through town. Sometimes, he lets the unemployed work off their garbage and sewer bills. ""I'll have 'em sweep the streets, pull up the grass. If they can do mechanic work, I'll let 'em work on the police cars."" Other than that, a good many Smithers residents eke out a living on unemployment or Social Security checks, federal black lung payments, surplus foods, free lunches - and the lifestyle of the hunter-gatherer. ""They fish, they hunt, they grow gardens,"" Long said."
"After seven months of deliberation, the federal Gold Commission tentatively voted yesterday against a return to the gold standard, a move some of President Reagan‰Ûªs supply-side supporters insist is the only way to bring down interest rates and inflation.</br></br>The commission's preliminary vote came just days after the Reagan administration, in the president‰Ûªs economic report to Congress, said ‰ÛÏThe evidence does not suggest that [the gold standard| achieved greater stability in price levels or growth.""

"Private-equity firms Berkshire Partners LLC and Weston Presidio plan to acquire party-goods maker Amscan Holdings Inc. for about $140 million plus $400 million in debt, according to people familiar with the matter.</br></br>Amscan, Elmsford, N.Y., makes party goods such as printed plates, napkins, and wedding and birthday gifts. It also is the world's largest maker of metallic party balloons. Last year, the company posted sales of about $400 million, up from $210 million in 1997.</br></br>A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. private-equity vehicle took the company private in 1997, paying $290 million for its then-publicly traded stock. Since then, GS Capital Partners II LP has invested $77 million in the business, in part to purchase other balloon-making companies.</br></br>The new buyers are expected to recapitalize the company, paying off $295 million in existing debt and, with borrowing arranged by Goldman Sachs, pay $245 million to the existing equity holders. An announcement could come as early as today, with the transaction closing midyear.</br></br>The deal is the latest in a growing number of transactions between private-equity firms. With low interest rates, the firms have been able to stay competitive in bidding wars with corporate buyers. Indeed, a person familiar with the Amscan transaction says the private-equity group beat out potential strategic buyers."
"WASHINGTON -- Worker productivity in nonfarm businesses edged up at a 0.1% annual rate in the fourth quarter, the Labor Department said in revisions of an earlier report that said the figure was unchanged.</br></br>Productivity, or output for each hour of work, climbed at an annual rate of 2% in the third quarter and dropped at a 2.4% rate in the second.</br></br>The department estimated that productivity for all businesses, including farms, declined at a 2% annual rate in the fourth quarter, the same as originally reported. A drop in farm output stemming from last summer's drought was largely responsible.</br></br>Growth in productivity is critical to the economy if it is to continue expanding without inflation.</br></br>Unit labor costs increased at an annual rate of 5.6% in the fourth quarter, as the department initially calculated, after increasing at a 3.7% annual rate in the third quarter and a 6.8% annual rate in the second."
"House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), reacting to a news report that former Federal Reserve governor Wayne Angell was leaked sensitive Fed data, yesterday urged the central bank to adopt ""policies which forbid the sale or exploitation of the Fed's confidential inside information.""</br></br>Gonzalez was responding in part to a report in Thursday's New York Times that quoted Angell as saying that the Fed's inspector general had questioned him about a possible leak of confidential information regarding changes in the central bank's discount rate, the interest rate the Fed charges on loans made directly to financial institutions.</br></br>Angell, who now works for Bear, Stearns & Co., a New York investment banking and securities firm, wrote a recent report for clients in which he said eight or nine of the Fed's 12 regional banks had asked the Fed's board in Washington for permission to increase their 3 percent discount rates. The board approved increases to 3.5 percent at all the banks this week.</br></br>Angell was traveling in Chicago yesterday and did not return phone calls seeking information. However, according to the Dow Jones News Service, Angell said there is no ongoing investigation by the Fed and that the earlier news reports were exaggerated.</br></br>In a letter to Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, Gonzalez broadly criticized the way Angell has used his knowledge of sensitive Fed matters in advising clients since he left the central bank in February."
"TINGO MARIA, Peru -- Some of the best coca in the world -- the stuff that is refined into cocaine -- comes from Tingo Maria and the surrounding area on the edge of the Amazon jungle.</br></br>But cocaine isn't the reason that Felipe Aponte Ortiz, blindfolded and barefoot, has been hauled into a police interrogation room. Mr. Aponte, 36 years old, is in jail because he is a guerrilla, as his suitcase full of Marxist literature and home-made explosives quickly establishes. He is Comrade Campa, a leading ideologue on the local committee of the Shining Path, Peru's increasingly violent Maoist insurgents.</br></br>The presence of Mr. Aponte and others like him in Peru's coca-growing regions has the government worried. In the past 10 months, the Shining Path has successfully turned local fury over a U.S.-backed coca-eradication program into a campaign of antigovernment violence. They have formed dozens of local Shining Path cells and bombed 10 of the area's 13 civil guard stations. In effect, officials say, the guerrillas have opened a second front 500 miles north of the 13-province emergency zone that until now has been the only center of guerrilla operations.</br></br>The new support for the guerrillas could endanger the already troubled U.S.-aided program to destroy Peru's coca crop, which accounts for about half of the cocaine smuggled into the U.S. And it has shaken President Fernando Belaunde Terry's four-year-old civilian government. Mr. Belaunde, also beset by an economic crisis, has been forced to ask the army to fight the guerrillas -- a politically dangerous move in a country where the army has ruled for 12 of the past 16 years.</br></br>""Call it subversion or what you will, it's a civil war,"" says Lt. Col. Guillermo Espino, the local police chief."
"Companies continued to shed workers in April, and the latest data gave little indication that a significant job-market rebound is imminent.</br></br>In its latest monthly employment report, the Labor Department said U.S. nonagricultural companies eliminated 48,000 payroll jobs last month, following a combined decline of 477,000 jobs in February and March. Although the decline wasn't as steep as some had expected, other statistics in the report clearly suggested that the labor market is weaker than many economists anticipated.</br></br>For example, job losses in the manufacturing sector were enormous; jobs fell 95,000 in April. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, rose to 6% from 5.8%. Most troublesome, the average workweek fell 0.3 hour, an indication that companies don't have enough work to occupy even those employees that remain after the latest cuts. Many economists say hiring will pick up only after there is an uptick in hours worked, since companies generally try to make their existing employees work longer before they hire additional people.</br></br>In Washington, President Bush used the jump in the unemployment rate to spur members of Congress to pass a ""robust"" tax-cut package to stimulate the economy. Speaking to defense workers in California, the president took the issue of the rising jobless rate, a potential political liability, and turned it to his advantage. The rising unemployment rate, he said, ""should serve as a clear signal to the United States Congress we need a bold economic recovery package so people can find work.""</br></br>Since the jobs report shows no sign of the postwar pickup that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has been predicting, it will probably make some already-pessimistic Fed officials even more convinced an immediate cut in interest rates is needed. However, Mr. Greenspan told Congress last week that only ""limited"" information is available on the economy's performance since war uncertainty began to lift, though he already knew the job market had weakened further in April. That suggests he will counsel patience at tomorrow's central-banking meeting, rather than advocate cutting short-term rates from their current, 42-year low of 1.25%."
"Author: Abhrajit Gangopadhyay</br></br>NEW DELHI -- India's food inflation rate turned up a tad in the week ended Nov. 27, but stayed below double digits, easing immediate pressure on the central bank to tighten monetary policy further though rising global commodity prices are a concern.</br></br>The food inflation rate, based on the wholesale price index, rose 8.69% from a year earlier, compared with 8.60% in the week through Nov. 20 as egg, meat, fish and onion became costlier, according to data issued Thursday by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.</br></br>Food inflation is the primary culprit driving up overall prices in Asia's third-largest economy, but as summer-sown crops enter the market, boosting staple supplies, the number is showing signs of easing. Last week, the food price inflation eased to the single digit for the first time since May 2009.</br></br>However, that doesn't offer much peace to the central bank that is cautiously watching rising global commodity prices, which could be the next trigger to drive India's inflation."
"U.S. Treasury prices declined after the Federal Reserve stopped short of delivering a new stimulus program to bolster the economy, instead reiterating its willingness to act if necessary.</br></br>In late-afternoon trade, the 30-year bond sank 31/32 in price to yield 2.594%, while benchmark 10-year notes lost 16/32 to yield 1.522%. The two-year note was down 1/32 to yield 0.235%. Bond yields rise when prices fall.</br></br>The losses came after a brief pop in long-end prices as disappointed investors scurried out of riskier stocks and into safe-haven Treasurys.</br></br>Some investors, particularly within the equity markets, had been hopeful that the central bank would step in given the recent downturn in economic signals. Bond analysts had been a bit more reserved, skeptical that the Fed would act before seeing another two months of employment data. At most, they had believed the Fed would push out its rate guidance to 2015.</br></br>But the policy makers didn't even do that, keeping the Fed's guidance through late 2014."
"Investors who rushed to the relative safety of bond funds when the stock market began to stagger last year might have thought they had outrun the troubles in equities -- only to face the new threat of inflation when oil prices started soaring. But with the cost of crude now falling, some fixed-income investors could find themselves in an enviable position.</br></br>While economists and market watchers debate the reasons behind the drop that has left oil down more than $30 a barrel from its July 11 high of $147.27, most investors are probably simply relieved to see a pullback. In the case of bonds, lower prices for oil and other commodities can reduce the risks of inflation eating into returns. And if the decline in oil signals a slowing global economy rather than an overheated market taking a break, the sure-footedness of bonds could look even more attractive.</br></br>Most investors find it easier to rely on bond funds rather than trying to navigate the complexities of the bond markets. A fund also will probably mean holdings are more safely spread out over a range of investments.</br></br>Compared with the stock market, which has been pounded by the credit crisis, many types of bond funds have fared reasonably well over the past year. The credit problems have exacted a toll on riskier parts of the market, including the asset-backed debt that includes mortgages, car loans and credit cards. But government bond funds, for example, have held up.</br></br>However, despite bond funds' relative soundness, investors have been concerned about the problems that inflation poses for their holdings."
"Rates on 30-year mortgages remained almost flat this week as the Federal Reserve said it would keep interest rates near record lows to help the economy recover.</br></br>The average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 4.98 percent this week, down from 4.99 percent last week, Freddie Mac said Thursday. Last year at this time, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 5.10 percent.</br></br>Rates are still above the record low of 4.71 percent set in early December. They've been held around 5 percent by a Federal Reserve program to pump $1.25 trillion into mortgage-backed securities to try to keep home-loan rates low, making home buying more affordable.</br></br>On Wednesday, the Fed said it still expects to end the program as scheduled on March 31. However, the central bank did say that it remains open to changing the timetable if necessary.</br></br>The average rate on 15-year, fixed-rate mortgages fell slightly, to 4.39 percent from 4.40 percent. Rates on five-year, adjustable-rate mortgages averaged 4.25 percent, down from 4.27 percent. Rates on one-year ARMs dropped to 4.29 percent from 4.32 percent."
"Sobered by store closings and the rise of online shopping, owners of U.S. shopping centers are filling space and drawing visitors by turning to unusual tenants like gun ranges and go-cart tracks.</br></br>Mall giant Simon Property Group Inc. opened an aquarium in July at its Grapevine Mills mall near Dallas. Real-estate brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. put a fencing academy in a former Old Navy store in Florida's Tallahassee Mall, and a community theater on the lower level of a former Boscov's store in Harrisburg, Pa.</br></br>Aqua Tots Holdings LLC, a business that teaches youngsters to swim, has expanded to 14 locations in Arizona, Texas and Georgia and has 10 more on the way, nearly all in former retail shops. Jumpstreet, an indoor trampoline facility, is buying or leasing former grocery stores, filling them wall-to-wall with trampolines and charging patrons for hourly access.</br></br>Perhaps the most unusual use of a former big-box store is William James's Arms Room gun shop and shooting range, which opened last year in a former Circuit City store south of Houston. Mr. James spent nearly $5 million to buy the 20,000-square-foot space and convert it into a shooting range, a price he considered a bargain compared with building from scratch. The Arms Room offers handgun training courses in addition to traditional shooting practice, all in a popular shopping center anchored by Target Corp. and Home Depot Inc. stores.</br></br>""It was sort of providential,"" Mr. James said in his Arms Room office, surrounded by antique swords and modern firearms.

"WASHINGTON--Coming off one of the most difficult weeks of his presidency, Barack Obama has beefed up his political staff and is expected to deliver an uncompromising State of the Union address. Aides said Sunday that the White House wasn't making any abrupt policy shifts, even as the message was retooled to focus more sharply on job creation.</br></br>If anything, an unfinished agenda from 2009 will grow larger as, in addition to tackling health care and unemployment, the president presses for a bipartisan commission to tackle the budget deficit against resistance from Republicans.</br></br>White House officials said Obama campaign manager David Plouffe would be brought on as a political consultant as the White House gears up for the midterm elections.</br></br>The president's party is facing a stiff headwind from an electorate angry about high unemployment and what they see as ineffectual government, White House officials said.

""If they have a job, they're working harder for less. They're falling behind. That's been true for a decade. They look at a wave of irresponsibility from Wall Street to Washington that led to that.

"Veteran Ward 8 political activist Philip E. Pannell finally found work after 19 months in the unemployment wilderness. But after just three weeks on the job, Pannell resigned in anger, accusing his new employer -- a nonprofit organization that serves public charter schools -- of improperly forbidding him to campaign against Ward 7 council member Kevin P. Chavous.</br></br>The way Pannell tells it, he was hired in late May to serve as outreach coordinator for the PCS Center for Student Support Services, which informs D.C. residents about education options in the public school system.</br></br>Three days after he started work, the center's executive director, Eve Brooks, got a call from an aide to Chavous, who chairs the council's education committee.</br></br>The aide informed Brooks that Chavous was ""really angry that I'd been hired,"" Pannell said. Pannell has long maintained an adversarial relationship with Chavous. Most recently, he helped engineer a takeover of the Ward 7 Democrats on behalf of Vincent Gray, Chavous's strongest challenger in the Sept. 14 Democratic primary.</br></br>Pannell said Brooks told him to be careful because ""Chavous is a good friend of charter schools."" Pannell said Brooks also threatened to fire him ""if I find out you're doing anything for Vince Gray."""
"For some time now, it has been apparent that something has gone askew with the old-time relationship of economic growth to job creation. In the past couple of years, new technologies have enabled many companies, especially large manufacturers, to churn out the same volume of production with fewer and fewer employees.</br></br>This phenomenon may represent a disconnect between economic growth and jobs, and set back President Clinton's hope for a meaningful economic recovery. The fact that unemployment sticks around 7 percent disturbs consumer confidence - not only among those out of work, but among people who still have jobs.</br></br>Some analysts contend that there really is nothing new in the equation that a surge in demand won't cure: Eventually, optimists say, companies now using overtime and temporary workers to fill their labor needs will have to add to regular payrolls.</br></br>But what will produce that rising demand? In the face of the deficit reduction program, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen admitted to a group of reporters last Tuesday, ""the second half {of 1993} will be better, but 1994 will not be a robust year."" He concedes that the net effect of deficit reduction - assuming that the Clinton package passes - could depress the economy.</br></br>On top of all the other bad news, the Federal Reserve Board seems to be itching to raise interest rates. That could set up a classic confrontation between the administration and the supposedly friendly chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, who said last week: ""The signal we are endeavoring to send here is that at some point, rates are going to have to move up."" If a few members of the Fed's top policy board had had their way, rates already would have been nudged up a notch or two."
"Gold prices fell Monday, as last week's fears of a direct military confrontation between Russia and Ukraine have proven unfounded, leaving the precious metal vulnerable to concerns about higher interest rates in the U.S.</br></br>Gold for December delivery, the most actively traded contract, settled down $6.90, or 0.5%, at $1,299.30 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.</br></br>Ukrainian officials said Friday that the country's army had partially destroyed a column of Russian military vehicles that had entered its territory, The news sent gold prices higher on worries that the two countries were heading toward a military escalation. Some investors buy gold during times of geopolitical or economic uncertainty, believing the metal will hold its value better than other assets.</br></br>By Monday, however, there was little evidence that the conflict would widen, as Kiev sought to play down the clash's significance, while Moscow called reports of the battle ""some kind of fantasy."" Western officials criticized the apparent incursion, but some played down the significance of the incident, noting that military equipment were believed to have been flowing over the border to pro-Russia separatists for months.</br></br>Investors exited gold, which has been weighed down by worries of tightening monetary policy in the U.S. Higher interest rates are seen as a negative influence for gold, which costs money to hold and struggles to compete with yield-bearing investments. A stronger dollar and rising stocks also detracted from gold's appeal."

"NEW YORK -- This isn't fur-buying season, but buying fur retailers seems to be getting trendy.</br></br>Centaur Partners II, a Bethesda, Md., investment partnership, said last week that it has amassed 25.6% of Fur Vault Inc. and may buy more. Just last month, a group of Canadians in the fur business bought a controlling interest in Antonovich Inc., another of the small handful of public fur retailers.</br></br>Fur-industry experts say the buying activity in the two firms, while unrelated, indicates that the business may be poised for profitability after several dismal years. In 1987, retail demand was strong and skin prices soared, but after the stock market crashed in October, sales plummeted and many fur stores were left with bloated -- and expensive -- inventories. Both Fur Vault and Antonovich posted losses two years in a row.</br></br>Melvyn J. Estrin, one of Centaur's partners, said in an interview, ""We believe this is an undervalued stock."" Fur Vault went public in 1984 at $11 a share and got as high as $15 in 1987, but it has been languishing lately at about $2.50. Centaur has been buying the stock for as much as $4.50 a share and now has 3.2 million common shares. Fur Vault shares fell 12.5 cents to $3.875 Friday in American Stock Exchange composite trading.</br></br>Mr. Estrin described Centaur's intentions as ""friendly.""

"At first glance, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III appeared to have made a major gain yesterday in his efforts to buoy the world economy.</br></br>The decision yesterday by seven European central banks to lower key interest ratescapped a 10-day period during which European governments announced a steady stream of fiscal and monetary measures aimed at spurring economic growth. The actions, which Baker strongly urged, raised hopes that the Treasury chief will soon engineer an international agreement designed to check the dollar's precipitous fall, hold down interest rates and avert worldwide recession.</br></br>Such an agreement, in turn, could bolster Baker's hopes of keeping the economy afloat during the 1988 election campaign, with obvious benefits for the Republican side.</br></br>But many economists caution that Baker's initiatives won't fundamentally alter the global economy's underlying problems. In their view, Baker appears to be obtaining only modest progress toward shrinking the huge U.S. budget and trade deficits and the need to borrow vast sums of money from abroad.</br></br>And as yesterday's steep stock market decline makes plain, Baker's efforts may not be enough to ward off new waves of pessimism in financial markets in the months ahead."

Managed-payout mutual funds offer an answer.</br></br>Designed by some of the biggest names in the financial-services business -- Vanguard Group, Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab, among others -- these investments use different strategies but start with the same concept: Place a pool of money in a range of investments, much like an endowment at a university. Ideally, the funds generate a predictable, but not guaranteed, stream of income in a format that gives investors easy access to their money.</br></br>That kind of predictability already was available from insurer-run annuities.

"THE BIRTHDAY of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. is a national holiday because he spoke to all Americans, by word and example, about what it meant to be an American. Dr. King's message, finally, was not about race but justice, not about power but love.</br></br>Since Dr. King's death, the word love has not been much invoked in our political discourse, about race or anything else. It strikes the ear of 1993 as naive, a word that can't teach us much about either the causes or remedies of injustice. Politics is dominated by the language of power, social policy by numbers or ideology. Talk about race is accented by mistrust, anger and despair.</br></br>Dr. King understood all this, but fought it throughout his life. A preacher of the Gospel, he understood that his task was not simply to organize his friends but to convert his enemies. ""The best way to assure oneself that love is disinterested,"" he said, ""is to have love for the enemy neighbor from whom you expect no good in return, but only hostility and persecution.""</br></br>In other hands, this might seem a recipe for resignation. On the contrary, Dr. King argued, only the strong could love. In his hands, love became a revolutionary concept that called into question the arrangements people accept on a day-to-day basis as ""normal."" ""The hardhearted individual never sees people as people, but rather as mere objects or as impersonal cogs in an ever-turning wheel,"" he said in a sermon reprinted in his book ""The Strength to Love."" ""In the vast wheel of industry, he sees men as hands. In the massive wheel of big city life, he sees men as digits in a multitude. In the deadly wheel of army life, he sees men as numbers in a regiment. He depersonalizes life.""</br></br>With love as a prism, Dr. King saw his way to a devastating critique of racial oppression in this country - but also to a solution. He demonized no one, lost hope in no one. His immediate cause was civil rights for African Americans, but his goal was an America that lived up to its promises - promises he revered. His was ""a dream deeply rooted in the American dream, that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal."""

"When it comes to the factors that influence electric-utility stocks, interest rates may be only half the story.</br></br>Utility stocks have been in the dumps this year, mainly because rising interest rates make their dividends seem less attractive and increase their financing costs. But William F. Klausing, senior vice president of Irving Trust's public utilities division, argues that ""interest rates are less important today than years ago in analyzing"" utility stocks. ""It's a whole new ballgame,"" he adds.</br></br>Mr. Klausing's point, echoed by some analysts, is that, after many years of multibillion dollar construction programs, utilities no longer borrow large amounts to build new plants because such investments appear too risky politically. Hence, the expenses of utilities have become less sensitive to interest rates.</br></br>To be sure, state regulators are trimming utilities' authorized rates of return -- and hence their profit potential -- in response to interest rate declines in the past few years. But, analysts note, many utilities have become units of holding companies. Profit from these publicly traded firms' non-regulated operations -- and from sales of electricity in the wholesale or bulk-power market -- have become important to a company's overall profitability.</br></br>So what should the savvy investor look for in an electric-utility stock?"
"Three American economists won the Nobel Prize for work that centers on how mechanisms such as markets and auctions can get people to admit how much something is worth to them.</br></br>Americans Leonid Hurwicz, Eric S. Maskin and Roger B. Myerson were awarded the Nobel prize in economics Monday for their study of ""mechanism design."" An abstract branch of economics that employs daunting formulas and heroic feats of mathematics, mechanism design is decidedly clear-eyed in its approach understanding always-less-than- perfect circumstances of economic exchanges. One way to understand the ""mechanisms"" these distinguished dismal scientists study is to think about an auction for, say, a Picasso painting. It's a pretty efficient way of getting people to admit -- by bidding -- how much they value the painting. And according to Tyler Cowen, a professor of economics at George Mason University and well-known economics blogger, essentially, these economists use math to analyze and describe that process of ""trying to get people to tell the truth or reveal information."" Jeffrey Ely, an economics professor at Northwestern University who works in the field, explains mechanism design as a sort of reverse engineering of game theory, a field in which people try to understand how individual incentives and structural rules interact and result in certain behaviors. But instead of just understanding the rules of existing systems, mechanism design focuses on designing them in such as way that a certain outcome is achieved. ""They developed the basic tools for thinking about institutions in this way,"" Mr. Ely said of today's award winners.</br></br>Alvin Roth is a professor of economics at Harvard University who has used some of the theories pioneered by today's Nobel award winners to help design programs such as the process by which medical students are placed in residency programs at hospitals. ""You might say that before modern game theory, economists looked at markets and other economic institutions sort of the way botanists look at plants, as naturally occurring mysteries to be studied,"" Mr. Roth wrote in an email. ""Mechanism design takes seriously that markets are built by people, and starts to ask what we can do with them, what we can't, and how best to go about it."" As such, their work has applications in a wide range of fields, from regulatory policies such as the Federal Communications Commission's somewhat abstract auctions of bandwidth on the wireless spectrum, to the residency-placement system devised Mr. Roth, to the kidney-donation swaps highlighted in today's Wall Street Journal. And, more generally, the economists' theories can be used as a framework to help identify when markets, auctions or other mechanisms -- such as matching programs -- might be better -- or ill -- suited for providing a specific outcome.</br></br>At 90 years old, Mr. Hurwicz is the oldest Nobel winner ever, according to the academy. Mr. Maskin, 56 years old, is professor at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, N.J.; and Mr. Myerson, 56, is a professor at the University of Chicago. The award is officially known as the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. It isn't one of the original Nobel Prizes, but was created in 1968 by the Swedish central bank in Alfred Nobel's memory. Nobel Prize winners receive $1.5 million, a gold medal and a diploma from the Swedish king on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896.</br></br>---"

"HANOI, Vietnam -- In a further sign of the grim business climate here, some of Vietnam's early-bird investors are flocking home.</br></br>These investors represent that first wave of daring foreigners who jumped in when Vietnam first began opening its market in the early 1990s.

"A proposal to offer discount Metrorail fares for short trips helped persuade Metro board members yesterday to support an average increase in rail and bus fares of 12 percent in June and an additional 6 percent next summer.</br></br>When General Manager David L. Gunn proposed the two-step fare increase last week, the District's representatives on the board objected because the plan would raise Metro's minimum fare for short trips about 18 percent - from 85 cents to $1 - while the cost of longer trips would go up by smaller percentages over two years. The maximum fare would rise from $2.55 to $2.85 on June 30 and to $3.15 in June 1992.</br></br>Gunn added a twist yesterday to his proposal: A special rail farecard for $4.75 that would provide five short rides for 95 cents each. Board members agreed, clearing the way for a final vote on the fare increase by May 2.</br></br>Saving a nickel on trips under three miles would amount to a 12 percent fare increase for those who use the special card. The discount would be available only between June and next summer. The cards would be available at all Metro sales outlets.</br></br>Of 142,000 rail trips taken each day by District residents, about 38 percent are shorter than three miles and would qualify for the discount. Throughout the system, short trips make up about 135,000 of Metro's 520,000 weekday rail trips."
"BOSTON -- The Christian Science Monitor's editor, Katherine Fanning, resigned along with her two top assistants to protest a restructuring they say will weaken the paper.</br></br>The restructuring will include staff cuts and other cost-reducing measures. It is aimed at narrowing the newspaper's losses at a time when the Christian Science Church, which owns the paper, faces financial strains from heavy outlays for a new television news program and a reduction in working funds because of the stock-market crash. A new format being considered for the Monitor would reduce the paper to 16 pages from its 28-page average, a church official said. The Monitor may also eliminate advertising.</br></br>As part of the restructuring, Richard A.

"If Bob Dole had been elected president in 1988, dealing with the federal deficit would have been his top priority, and there's little doubt in my mind it would be under control by now.</br></br>The deficit has not been a priority for President Bush, except for a brief period in 1990, and so it has ballooned from $154 billion to $400 billion a year. Given the course of his campaign so far, there's every reason to expect more of the same if he is reelected.</br></br>The Post rightly honors Dole as one of a small group of senators who have courageously fought to eliminate the deficit over the years. And he really paid a political price for his courage in the New Hampshire Republican primary of 1988.</br></br>Dole came into New Hampshire as the front-runner, leading in the polls and having beaten Vice President Bush in Iowa. The vice president actually ran third in Iowa, behind both Dole and the Rev. Pat Robertson.</br></br>Bush came out swinging in New Hampshire.

"With spending for defense, farm price supports, unemployment benefits and Medicare running lower than expected, the federal budget deficit for fiscal 1983 could turn out to be $200 billion or less, some $10 billion below the Reagan administration‰Ûªs mid-July estimate.</br></br>Officials at the Congressional Budget Office and a number of private forecasters estimating the lower spending figures for the fiscal year ending next week say a variety of factors are responsible, including lower fuel costs at the Department of Defense and the summer-long drought that has induced many farmers to sell grain and pay off outstanding government loans.</br></br>Outlays probably will turn out to be $800 billion, compared with an administration estimate of $809.8 billion, the sources say. The recent sale by the government of Chrysler Corp. stock warrants netted $311 million, while the Export-Import Bank received an unexpected repayment of $400 million from the Iranian government.

"TiVo Inc. said it received an important patent associated with disc-based video recorders but also announced a fiscal first-quarter net loss that more than doubled from a year earlier.</br></br>Analysts said the patent boosts the prospects for TiVo to get additional revenue from licensing its technologies. TiVo said it already has a licensing agreement with the original equipment makers that manufacture its recorders. But with the patent, it has the right to license its technologies to cable providers, competitors and other companies. In response, TiVo's shares rose $3.56, or 72%, to $8.50 at 4 p.m. on the Nasdaq Stock Market.</br></br>Personal video recorders such as TiVo's record TV programming work in a way that, among other things, let users effectively pause live broadcasts or skip over commercials.</br></br>The Alviso, Calif., company said the patent covers many of the inventions associated with the devices, including a method for recording a TV program while playing back another or watching a program as it is being recorded; a method for processing various multimedia streams such as video and audio at low cost; and a storage format that allows users to pause and scan through a live TV broadcast.</br></br>TiVo could use a boost. The company reported after the market closed that its net loss for the period ended April 30 widened to $49.1 million, or $1.20 a share, from $23.5 million, or 66 cents a share, a year earlier."

"When Israeli radio and television personnel recently went on strike, both services shut down, and news reports went off the air.

Most Israelis believed that the unusual silence was a real pleasure-a mecheieh in Yiddish.</br></br>People could go about their affairs without the foreboding that they are on the verge of an impending crisis. An unforeseen and not inconsiderable benefit was the sharp reduction in traffic accidents.</br></br>There is an important lesson here for us as well.

"John Steele Gordon's ""The Little Miracle Spurring Inequality"" (op-ed, June 3) is short on facts. For example, he could have cited figures showing how the share of the country's wealth held by the top 1% has gone from approximately 25% in 1981 to approximately 35% in 2010.</br></br>He could also have mentioned that the Gini coefficient, a broad-based, widely accepted measure of income inequality, for the U.S. was higher than in Sweden, Norway, Austria, Germany, Denmark, Austria, Italy, Canada, France, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Japan, Israel, Iran, etc.</br></br>I agree with Mr. Gordon that capitalism has benefited more people than any other widely practiced economic system.

"The dollar eased in anemic foreign exchange trading as many participants continued to sit out the market and await the new year.</br></br>The dollar barely moved from Friday's levels all day. It was supported partly by the expectation that the Group of Seven leading industrial nations will reaffirm the Louvre currency-stabilization agreement by year end.

"NEW YORK -- Junk-bond investors were buried under an avalanche of corporate defaults in 1990. And according to analysts, the worst is yet to come.</br></br>""Defaults will not slow down,"" said Mark Backman, a senior vice president at Standard & Poor's Corp., the credit-rating concern. ""There still are many highly leveraged companies that are close to or on the verge of defaulting,"" he said.</br></br>There are a number of trends working against heavily indebted companies, the group of firms considered the most likely candidates to default on bond payments. All of the companies that defaulted during 1990 had debt ratings that were below investment grade, a category often referred to as ""junk."" No company with an investment-grade rating defaulted.</br></br>Many analysts blame the economic recession for the rise in defaults in the past year. And as the business downturn deepens, making it difficult for companies to meet debt payments as their revenue dwindles, the analysts expect junk-bond defaults to multiply.</br></br>The junk-bond market has shriveled, with only $1.4 billion of new junk-bond issues during 1990. And the reluctance of banks to continue to finance marginal companies has left these companies with scant room to maneuver."
"This is the time of year when colleges and universities decide on the Class of 2010. It's also when students and parents are in full- throated gripe about the admissions lottery, the opaque system by which high school seniors are accepted or rejected.</br></br>We don't pretend to understand all of the mysteries of this ultimately arbitrary process. But for all of its imperfections -- witness the former Taliban spokesman who won a coveted slot at Yale, or the recent SAT scoring screwup -- on the whole the college- admissions process does a good job of matching students and schools in what continues to be the best system of higher education in the world. And it even lets us say something good for a change about Harvard -- and Yale too.</br></br>Cynics will note that the way to get into elite universities is to be a minority, the child of an alum, have a 4.0 GPA and perfect SAT scores, or be a star quarterback or piccolo player. It certainly doesn't hurt to come from a geographically ""diverse"" place such as Wyoming. And, oh, did we mention that it would help if junior spent last summer scaling Mount Everest or writing a novel?</br></br>Diversity is a much-maligned word these days -- and for good reason when it is used as justification for racial preferences -- but it is also one of the strengths of U.S. colleges. Unlike virtually everywhere else in the world, applicants to U.S. universities aren't usually selected by a set of fixed academic criteria. Most foreign universities couldn't care less about students' extracurricular activities or whether their parents wore the old school tie.</br></br>In Japan, entrance exams are everything. All the University of Tokyo cares about is how a kid scores on a test he has spent four years cramming for. European universities show somewhat more flexibility, but if you haven't followed an approved course of study in high school -- to which students are tracked at the age of 10 or 12 -- you can pretty much forget about college."
"We've just finished celebrating the Fourth of July. What better time than now to contemplate the state of our nation's independence? Financial independence, that is.</br></br>Here's the deal. The United States has the mightiest economy in the world, but we've become enormously dependent on foreign investors to lend us the money it takes to keep Uncle Sam's checks from bouncing. At least, that's how I interpret Treasury statistics that track the size and ownership of our national debt.</br></br>The statistics show that foreign and international investors account for the entire increase in privately owned Treasury securities since George W. Bush took office. Issuing those securities is how the Treasury covered federal budget shortfalls. Privately owned Treasury securities are those that belong to investors, as opposed to those owned by federal government trust funds or the Federal Reserve Board. Private investors own about half our $7 trillion-plus of national debt; the Fed and federal trust funds own the rest.</br></br>According to Treasury data -- table OFS-2, if you want see for yourself, on the Web at www.fms.treas.gov/bulletin/ b24ofs.doc -- when the Bush administration started, we had $2.88 trillion of privately held national debt, of which $1.03 trillion was owned by foreign and international investors. As of March 31, the most recent data available, privately owned debt had risen to $3.5 trillion, of which foreigners owned $1.71 trillion.</br></br>Now, a little math. Privately owned debt, as you can see, was up by $620 billion since the Bush administration started -- but foreigners' holdings were up by $680 billion. This means that foreigners accounted for the entire increase in privately held debt - - and then some."

"Existing-home sales climbed 9.4 percent in September to their highest level in more than two years, fueled by demand for cheap properties and an $8,000 tax credit for first-time buyers, according to industry data released Friday.</br></br>Sales of existing homes, including condos and single-family residences, reached an annual rate of 5.57 million units in September, their highest level since July 2007, according to the National Association of Realtors. The monthly increase was the largest on records that date back to 1999 and was far better than analysts had expected. Sales were up 9.2 percent from the same period a year ago.</br></br>This is the latest sign that the housing market has begun to rebound, if only temporarily, as buyers take advantage of record-low mortgage rates and pounce on cheap foreclosed properties, analysts said. Sales have increased five of the last six months and rose throughout the country last month. In the South, which includes the Washington region, sales rose 9 percent last month. Also, the inventory of homes on the market shrank again, though analysts said it needs to come down more. It would take 7.8 months to sell all of the homes on the market at the current rate.</br></br>""The supply of used homes for sale is also steadily declining, an encouraging trend,"" said Mike Larson, a real estate analyst at Weiss Research, a research firm.</br></br>But analysts said the market rebound may be temporary. An $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers expires Nov. 30, and sales will likely flatten or fall in the following months, analysts said. The tax credit generated temporary demand as buyers who otherwise may have waited to buy a house rushed to cash in before the credit vanished, analysts said."
"For at least 30 years the U.S. has had, or at least professed, one fiscal policy: Reduce the deficit, ideally to zero, preferably within five years.</br></br>I was never crazy about this policy. I never attached significance to the number ""zero."" The only thing one could say about zero was that it was $100 billion less than $100 billion and $100 billion more than negative $100 billion. This becomes obvious if you think of all the different plausible ways there are to define and measure budget surpluses and deficits.</br></br>In the early Reagan years, when the deficit was large, I was not among those most eager to reduce it. Although I believed that the deficit was retarding growth by absorbing private saving that would have been productively invested, I thought that we were a very rich country and had more important things to do than speed up growth. I was a strong supporter of the defense buildup and feared that the deficit argument would be used to restrain it.</br></br>Grand Goal in Sight</br></br>I changed my mind recently as the deficit declined; this year, the grand goal of zero seems finally achieved. In fact, I came to believe that balancing the budget was not enough and that we needed to get to a surplus. What changed my mind was the ever-clearer prospect that we would run huge deficits in the 21st century as baby boomers claimed their retirement and Medicare benefits. Although I was not one who wanted to maximize future growth, I would not like to see the growth of per capita income turn negative, and I was afraid that would happen if the federal deficit was so large as to absorb all private saving."
"The Washington metropolitan area had the highest per capita income of all the nation's urban areas in 1977, according to a survey by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Department of Commerce.</br></br>But the D.C. area slipped a couple of notches from the previous year in the overall ranking of 268 metropolitan areas, surveyed.</br></br>Washington was fifth with a per capita income of $9,306, 32 percent above the national average of $7,494. The figure represents an increase of 9.21 percent over the $8,521 for 1976 when the area ranked third.</br></br>Once again, Anchorage, Alaska, had the highest per capita income in the nation with $11,430 followed by Bridgeport - Stamford - Norwalk - Danbury, Conn. ($9,676), Reno, Nev. ($9,-368) and Midland, Texas ($9,307). The continued strong showing by Anchorage reflects the economic impact of both the Alaska pipeline and the area‰Ûªs higher cost of living, according to a Commerce Department spokesman.</br></br>The percentage increase in per capita income from 1976 to 1977 was greater than the 5.7 percent rise in the cost of living in all but three metropolitan areas.

"The problem of the burgeoning government debt is mainly political, but the adverse consequences may be economic. The trouble is that we don't know what those consequences may be, when they may occur or even whether they will occur. Without some impending calamity, politicians of both parties recoil from doing anything unpopular that might bring the budget into balance over, say, the next six or seven years. The idea of anticipating and preempting future problems is not on their agenda.</br></br>Although the recent surge of budget deficits -- the annual gaps between outlays and revenue, resulting in more federal debt -- reflects the savage recession, the true cause is political. Deficits allow liberals and conservatives to maintain self-serving public positions. Liberals claim we can have more government (more health care, more education, more transportation) without taxing anyone but ""the rich."" Conservatives promise that taxes can be cut without depriving anyone (retirees, veterans, cities and states) of existing government benefits.</br></br>Neither claim is remotely believable under the assumption that, over the long run, government benefits and programs ought to be paid for with taxes. The truth is that government, again under both parties, has promised far more in benefits than can be covered by existing taxes. Only borrowing could reconcile the rhetorical claims with underlying economic realities. There have been 43 deficits in the past 48 years.</br></br>Until recently, the borrowings, though usually undesirable, were not alarming. But the recession and an aging population signify that we have crossed a threshold where actual and prospective borrowings are so huge that no one can foresee the consequences. The best measure of debt burden is its relation to the nation's annual income, or gross domestic product. The same approach applied to a household with $25,000 of debt and $50,000 of income would produce a debt-to-income ratio of 50 percent.</br></br>In 1946, after World War II, the ratio of publicly held federal debt to GDP was 108.6 percent. Since then, the economy (our income) has generally grown faster than the debt. In 1974, the debt-to-GDP ratio reached a post-World War II low of 23.9 percent, and even in 2007, it was only 36.9 percent. That was manageable."
"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Use of stock-options contracts to hedge stock portfolios and speculate in the market is surging, pushing options trading to levels not seen since the 1987 stock-market crash.</br></br>Investor wariness as the Dow Jones Industrial Average continues to set records has helped bring new life to this previously moribund sector of the U.S. financial markets, as has the protracted takeover battle for Paramount Communications Inc.</br></br>""This long, drawn-out tender offer has proven to be very profitable for the options business,"" said Michael Schwartz, senior vice president at Oppenheimer & Co. ""But there also has been a steady turnaround in the business, with an influx of new users and a change of direction from index options to equity options.""</br></br>Many participants attending the Chicago Board Options Exchange convention here this weekend are wondering how long the nation's four major options exchanges can maintain their momentum.</br></br>Before last month, when these markets posted their highest daily and monthly volume totals in more than five years, the consensus in the U.S. options industry was that it had never really recovered from the crash. Thousands of overly aggressive investors, who used options contracts in risky, leveraged trading strategies, had been devastated in the 1987 cataclysm. And options trading fell sharply in the years that followed."
"Rising energy prices pushed U.S. consumer inflation up in February to its fastest rate in four months, the Labor Department reported, reinforcing concerns that inflation may be poised to take off in a way that would roil the U.S. economy.</br></br>The figures followed the Federal Reserve's clear warning Tuesday that it stands ready to raise interest rates more aggressively in coming months if necessary to keep inflation under control.</br></br>The danger, economists said, arises if Fed officials have to raise interest rates so high to choke off inflation that they also brake economic growth, driving stock prices down and unemployment up.</br></br>That worry is heightened by the fact that prices are rising faster than wages for most workers, which means their earnings have fallen over the past year after adjusting for inflation, sapping consumer buying power.</br></br>The consumer price index, the Labor Department's widely followed measure of inflation, rose 0.4 percent last month, up from a 0.1 percent increase in January, primarily because of a 2 percent gain in energy prices."

"Suppose you were told that the president would agree to a budget-balancing plan that exempts over half of total spending from cuts and requires that half the cuts come from defense. Further, suppose you were told that the plan would require cuts in affected areas of 10 to 15 percent over 4 consecutive years, while outlays in unaffected programs such as Social Security would rise steadily at about 7 percent a year.</br></br>Given these facts, you might suppose that a deficit reduction plan weighted against defense and in favor of Social Security might be justified by an imbalance between defense and social spending that had grown: up over past years.</br></br>But consider the facts: since 1967, the year before Lyndon Johnson‰Ûªs guns-and-butter budget proposed a record peacetime deficit of $25 billion, the share of GNP devoted to entitlements‰ÛÓincluding Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid‰ÛÓhas risen from 5.9 percent to 11.3 percent in 1985. Meanwhile, the share of GNP devoted to national defense has fallen from 9.2 percent in 1967 to 6.5 percent in 1985. Nondefense discretionary spending that finances government operations, grants to state and local governments, and research and education programs aimed at the young has stayed between 4 and 5 percent of GNP.</br></br>A clear pattern has developed. Defense spending is cyclical. It rose during the Vietnam conflict and fell sharply thereafter until 1981 when it reached 5.5 percent of GNP. In contrast, the growth of spending on entitlements has followed a steady, upward trend. During the decade between 1957 and 1967, spending on entitlements rose from 3.9 percent of GNP to 5.9 percent. It rose much more rapidly during the eight years after 1967, reaching 10.6 percent of GNP by 1975 and rising to over 11 percent of GNP in the 1980s.</br></br>It is the growth of spending on entitlements and other social programs that has made the guns-and-butter budget option far more expensive. Even Lyndon Johnson‰Ûªs 1968 guns-and-butter budget set out- lays at 21 percent of GNP. In 1985 the guns-and-butter option, with defense at 6.5 percent of GNP instead of 1968‰Ûªs 9.8 percent, cost nearly 25 percent of GNP. The difference absent a tax increase has meant deficits running at about 5 percent of GNP."
"The Federal Reserve, forced by Congress to release details on trillions of dollars' worth of loans made during the financial crisis, disclosed the breadth of its lending to U.S. businesses desperate to raise cash and the surprising degree to which it supported struggling foreign banks in the worst days of 2008 and 2009.</br></br>The lending, most of which has been paid back, represents the Fed's most aggressive intervention in the economy ever, and included loans to stalwart industrial companies such as General Electric Co. and Verizon Communications Inc. Though the Fed has been credited with helping prevent many banks and firms from collapsing as credit markets stopped functioning, critics also say the Fed overreached and the latest disclosures could open new fault lines.</br></br>The scale of the Fed's lending was widely known. In all it funneled $3.3 trillion worth of credit to different parts of the economy and financial system through an array of different programs during the crisis. But the specifics of who got the money hadn't been known.</br></br>Foreign banks received hundreds of billions of dollars in short-term loans from the Fed. Among the biggest loans from a Fed commercial-paper lending program was one to Swiss banking giant UBS AG, which tapped it for $37 billion in October 2008. Barclays PLC, the British bank that declined to rescue Lehman Brothers but later bought much of it from bankruptcy, tapped the Fed for roughly $10 billion in commercial-paper loans in October 2008.</br></br>All the borrowings were repaid by the end of 2009, a Barclays spokesman said. A UBS representative said its borrowing was relatively modest, done to give it flexibility during the crisis and was fully repaid."
"NEW YORK -- The economy maintained a hearty pace in November, though it slipped slightly from the previous month's surprisingly robust level, the nation's purchasing managers said.</br></br>The latest monthly survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management found that production and new order rates slowed from the previous month, but employment rose at the strongest rate in the past 12 months.</br></br>""November's robust showing underscores the strength remaining in the economy as it entered the seventh year of recovery,"" said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the group's national business survey committee.</br></br>Coming on the heels of the Labor Department's unexpectedly strong November job growth report on Friday, the purchasers' survey could exacerbate concern that the economy isn't cooling down as neatly or as notably as many economists thought. A too-strong economy raises worries that the Federal Reserve Board may curb credit in an effort to head off worrisome inflation.</br></br>The economy has been giving some mixed signals lately, and the purchasers' report also contains some disparate views. Mr. Bretz noted that the survey displayed ""some signs of softening, particularly in the export order growth rate."" But he added that ""the continued healthy level of new orders, combined with a solid downtrend in the inflation rate, virtually assures a strong fourth quarter."""
"China's inflation climbed to almost a 12-year high in April, swamping official efforts to cool surging living costs that could provoke unrest before the Beijing Olympics. The government, which took further steps to tame the inflation, faces the possibility of more sharp price increases, some analysts warned.</br></br>The government ordered banks to increase reserves for a fourth time this year in a move meant to contain inflation by curbing lending, but it did not say whether it would boost interest rates.</br></br>April's consumer prices rose by 8.5 percent over a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics reported. That was above March's 8.3 percent rate and was below February's 8.7 percent -- the highest in 12 years. April's inflation was driven by a 22.1 percent jump in food prices.</br></br>Chloride Group, Europe's largest maker of backup power supplies, rejected a preliminary $1.3 billion takeover approach from U.S. rival Emerson Electric.

"Just when you're thinking all hope is lost, along comes the ""void-for-vagueness doctrine,"" invoked this past week by the Supreme Court to restrict a hopelessly vague law. If our era needs a bumper sticker, this is it: Void for Vagueness. Paste it on the 2,000-plus pages of the new ObamaCare law, paste it on the 2,000 pages of the floundering financial regulation bill. Hand it out in front of Elena Kagan's confirmation hearings. Heck, chisel it on the facade of the U.S. Capitol. But my enthusiasm is racing ahead of the story.</br></br>In 2006, the most hated man in America was probably Jeff Skilling, who once sat atop Enron, perhaps the most hated corporate name in all American history. This heap of unpopularity notwithstanding, the Supreme Court said last week the government wrongly prosecuted the abominated Jeff Skilling under something called the ""honest services fraud"" law. The Court ruled -- unanimously -- that the law was, in a word, too ""vague.""</br></br>Here is the classic description of the void-for-vagueness doctrine from Justice George Sutherland in 1926: ""a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning . . . violates the first essential of due process of law.""</br></br>That any such common-sense rule still exists in law, politics or life is a wonder.</br></br>Strictly, the vagueness test applies only to penal law, but in a better world would it not also apply to much else in public life? The world was simpler in 1926."
"3.7	percent annual rate in the three months from April through June, it was highlighting the change in real, or inflation-adjusted, economic activity. After all, it is real growth, not inflation, that produces more jobs and a higher standard of living.</br></br>In fact, many of the news stories about the report, including the one in The Washington Post, did not mention that the current-dollar figure for the gross domestic product‰ÛÓas opposed to the inflation-adjusted figure‰ÛÓreached an annual rate of $6,684 trillion. The gross</br></br>But even if it gets little public attention, changes in current-dollar GDP, which are shown in the top line of the chart at the right, are a key economic indicator for Federal Reserve policy makers. For example, it is one of only four variables included every six months when the Fed officials provide their collective economic forecasts to Congress. The others are changes in real GDP, shown in the other line in the chart, consumer price inflation and the national unemployment rate.</br></br>Changes in current-dollar GDP are always the combination of some change in real growth, which as the chart shows turns</br></br>CURRENT-DOLLAR GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT gets far less attention ' than changes in inflation-adjusted GDP. which shows real economic growth.

"President Bush on Monday will tell the nation what he wants done with the budget next fiscal year. But the significance of his proposals and Congress's response is dwarfed by one daunting fact: Some 84 cents of every dollar the government spends is essentially committed before he and the legislators even have at it.</br></br>That is the amount that goes to three all-but-untouchable elements: interest on the federal debt; defense and homeland security; and, above all, ""entitlements"" programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.</br></br>It leaves just one-sixth of spending for nearly everything else the government does domestically, from secretaries' salaries to research -- what is known in budget jargon as ""discretionary"" spending.</br></br>Entitlements are the real elephant in the room. Formulas for spending on these social programs are set by law. Anyone eligible can collect. And the programs are growing far faster than either inflation or the economy, some 8% a year.</br></br>Medicare, at $391 billion this year, is close to equaling the entire domestic discretionary slice of the budget. Add in Social Security and the federal share of the state-run Medicaid program for the poor, and the big-three entitlements total $1.1 trillion for this year -- $3 billion a day. This spending is the big issue in the federal budget, not post-Katrina rebuilding, headline-grabbing pork like Alaska's ridiculed bridge to nowhere, or even the costly war in Iraq."
"In its glory days, which reached its penultimate moment 20 years ago yesterday, Florida's Cape Canaveral contained all the elements of a western frontier town. It was young, vibrant, bawdy, daring, full of get-rich-quick prospectors. In only two decades, the population of Brevard County jumped from 20,000 to 250,000. Throughout the '60s, the unemployment rate never went as high as 2 percent.</br></br>Ironically, the bubble burst precisely when the world fixed its eyes on the Cape to witness the greatest achievement of the space age-that most spectacular of spectaculars, man's voyage to the moon.</br></br>Crowds, a million strong, were drawn to those dunes and palms, motels, nightclubs and go-go palaces that had sprung up along the Cape to accommodate the explosive growth of America's space endeavor.</br></br>I remember especially the stir of throngs along the beaches that night before the moon launch and the intense excitement that gripped them. They were there to share in a moment that they would talk about the rest of their lives and pass on to their children.</br></br>Along with them, of course, were the usual signs of rampant hucksterism and boosterism. The locals, ministers, bankers, shop owners, assiduously were drawing attention to themselves."
"Most of the big banks are out with their first-quarter profits this week, and once again they are at record levels, as they were for much of last year. (Wachovia's net is up 30 percent, Suntrust's 36 percent and Bank of America's 75 percent from the comparable period last year.) Deposits are up, as are consumer lending and fees from investment banking, while most of the scandals are behind them. Bank stocks are on the rise, as are the annual pay packages of big bank chief executives, which now routinely top $15 million.</br></br>Much of the credit for this improvement in bank economics goes to consolidation and new technology, which have allowed banks to cut a huge chunk of their operating costs. It turns out there were significant scale efficiencies to be gained by combining back offices and branch networks. In addition, ATMs, automatic deposits, online bill paying and computerized loan approvals have allowed banks to shrink payrolls even as they grow their businesses.</br></br>So far, however, there is little evidence that all this new efficiency has benefited consumers in the form of lower fees and higher interest rates on deposits. Whereas in the past, banks were happy with net interest spreads -- roughly speaking, the interest rate difference between what banks pay depositors and what they charge borrowers -- of 2 percentage points, spreads now routinely top 3 percentage points. And fees for things like ATM withdrawals or bounced checks are higher in both absolute terms and as a share of bank profits.</br></br>The numbers for all this are surprisingly difficult to tease out from financial statements and regulatory filings. They bounce around from year to year and bank to bank, complicated by the effect of mergers. But it seems clear from conversations with local bankers that, rather than compete for depositors on the basis of price, banks have decided they are better off competing on the basis of service.</br></br>There are several possible explanations. As in any industry dominated by a handful of major players, price wars are not a very attractive strategy. Any bank that makes the first move to cut fees or raise deposit rates knows all too well that other banks have the wherewithal to match its offer. The resulting stalemate won't change anyone's market share, but it will lower everyone's profits."
"FRANKFURT, West Germany -- West Germany's central bank isn't expected to reduce its discount rate when its policy-setting panel meets tomorrow, despite pressure to follow recent cuts by the U.S. and Japan.</br></br>West German banking analysts said they expect the Bundesbank to leave the discount rate unchanged at 3.5% because of concern over money-supply growth and the German mark's weakness in the European Monetary System, a joint float of eight continental European currencies. The analysts said that if the central bank takes any action, it is likely to lower the Lombard rate, which currently is 5.5%.</br></br>The Lombard rate, a short-term fee under which banks borrow funds from the central bank using securities as collateral, has served as an upper marker for West German money-market rates. The discount rate, a longer-term rate under which banks can borrow using bills -- primarily government and commercial paper -- as collateral, serves as the central bank's key tool for steering market interest rates.</br></br>In Washington, the Treasury declined to comment on the possibility that the West German central bank might reduce its Lombard rate. But in general, U.S. reaction was muted.</br></br>The Reagan administration would prefer to see the Bundesbank cut its discount rate rather than the Lombard rate, which is narrower in scope. However, any cut in the Lombard rate still would be seen as a welcome gesture of West German support for the latest round of interest rate cuts and would be within the range the U.S. wants."
"Wall Street's major indicators rose again Thursday despite the falling dollar and signs of weaker consumer spending.</br></br>Although the weaker dollar raises the possibility of higher inflation, investors saw the U.S. currency's decline as an opportunity to help close the trade deficit, since U.S. goods will be less expensive abroad.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average rose 11.23, or 0.1 percent, to 10,827.12, its highest close since June 13. 2001.

The Nasdaq composite index gained 3.59, or 0.17 percent, to 2160.62.</br></br>For the week, the Dow rose 1.66 percent, the S&P 500 gained 1.33 percent, and the Nasdaq climbed 1.19 percent.

"Around midnight on April 15, 1912, there were a few minutes when Capt. Edward Smith of the Titanic realized his ship was going down -- six watertight compartments breached, less than two hours to float -- yet his passengers slept in happy ignorance. A historical fate hardened while most of the participants dreamed on.</br></br>The jobs report last week opened a long gash beneath the waterline of President Obama's legislative agenda. Few realize it, but a scramble for lifeboats is about to begin.</br></br>On closer inspection, the economic news, which seemed bad, is even worse. Not only did unemployment rise to 9.5 percent but wages fell, undermining the consumption needed to revive a consumption-driven economy. Unemployment increased among ""breadwinners"" -- married men and women who head households -- also making major family purchases more difficult. Recent increases in unemployment benefits and food stamps have helped many Americans pay for food and rent. Jobs, however, are what lead to the purchase of furniture, cars and homes. Paired with a decline in business investment, these trends make a second-half recovery less likely.</br></br>The stimulus package hasn't been very stimulating -- as many economists predicted. Pouring money into the economy through a thirsty sponge of federal programs -- the preferred method of Congress -- is slow and inefficient. In retrospect, all of the stimulus funds should have been given to individuals directly from the tap.</br></br>Obama's spending ambitions would have been jaw-dropping even in the best of economic times. Federal spending this year is about 28 percent of gross domestic product -- a figure exceeded only when Franklin Roosevelt was fighting a global war against Germany and Japan. Along the fiscal path Obama has chosen (according to the Congressional Budget Office) our national debt will more than double in 10 years and will amount to 82 percent of the entire economy."
"President Reagan, unable to meet his goal of cutting the federal deficit in half over three years, has essentially talked away from the problem, leaving to Congress the politically unpalatable choices on defense, taxes and Social Security.</br></br>What his senior officials hoped would be a fresh start this year with dramatic, early leadership by Reagan to trim the deficit‰ÛÓsimilar to months ago but now moribund, of cutting the deficit to $100 billion by 1988. ‰ÛÏOur budget is finished, and there is no way of reopening it.‰Û Reagan dominated the budget debate in his first year, but since</br></br>then he has increasingly pushed the hard choices over to Congress, delivering budgets that congressional leaders called ‰ÛÏdead on arrival.""

"THE SUPPLY-SIDE REVOLUTION: An Insider's Account of Policymaking in Washington. By Paul Craig Roberts. Harvard University Press. 327 pp. $18.50</br></br>THIS is a surprisingly interesting book, and one that needed to be written. I say surprising, because like most professionals in the world of finance I am skeptical about the writings of most economists. There are wonderful exceptions, thank heaven, but in general they share with other manipulators of abstractions, including investment advisers, a preference for mathematical models and desk analysis over direct observation: shoe leather. One thinks of Rabelais‰Ûª tale about the furious argument that convulsed the Sorbonne over the number of teeth in the head of a horse. The Aristotelians had one theory, the followers of Pliny another; the disciples of Saint Jerome anathematized all rivals. Finally, of course, some naif confounded the Schoolmen by actually peering inside the beast‰Ûªs mouth. These days, thanks to paperback sales and the lecture circuit, a theoretician can make a small fortune by working up a theory, giving it a snappy new name, and pushing it like a breakfast food: The Greening of America, Megatrends, or whatever. But that doesn‰Ûªt make it any more valid.</br></br>Anyway, here‰Ûªs a book by a modem Candide, who goes to work for President Reagan convinced that the president is right about two things: first, that you increase output by lowering disincentives; and second, that you collect more tax by not raising the rates so high that people will do almost anything to avoid paying them. (Roberts points out that the IRS‰Ûªs own figures show that as the top rates are lowered, the rich pay more tax, both in total dollars and relative to the poor.)</br></br>Both observation and common sense teach us these simple principles, or should. It seems scarcely necessary to coin a special name for them‰ÛÓ‰ÛÏsupply-side,‰Û ‰ÛÏKemp-Roth,‰Û ‰ÛÏReaganomics,‰Û or whatever‰ÛÓany more than one should need to call earning an honest living ‰ÛÏthe work ethic,‰Û but there it is. In any event, Roberts becomes a Treasury official to help the president carry out these ideas, and soon discovers that in addition to the swarms of special interests on the other side demanding higher spending and tax, right within the administration itself powerful factions are waging subtle warfare to defeat the president‰Ûªs objectives.</br></br>The Supply-Side Revolution describes some of the author‰Ûªs battles with both sets of antagonists. It is easy for one outside of government to understand what inspires representatives of specific groups‰ÛÓthe elderly, veterans, or whomever‰ÛÓto fight spending cuts affecting their constituency. Indeed, much of American politics now consists of identifying such a clientele, rounding them up into a politically influential mass, and presenting oneself as their last hope."
"During his final swing through Ohio before the state's primary tomorrow, Sen. Barack Obama has ramped up his attacks on predatory lending while muting his criticism of rival Sen. Hillary Clinton's proposal to freeze interest rates for five years on adjustable-rate mortgages.</br></br>Sen. Obama's approach underscores the tricky balancing act he faces: He has staked out a centrist position on the foreclosure crisis while he courts the voters in Ohio who have been hit hard by the foreclosure crisis.</br></br>Sen. Clinton advocates a more interventionist approach that promises immediate action. The New York senator's plan would freeze foreclosures for 90 days to allow lenders to work out problems with borrowers, and she wants the loan-rate freeze for certain mortgages. David Axelrod, an Obama campaign strategist, has acknowledged the ""political resonance"" of the Clinton plan, particularly in cities like Cleveland, which has the sixth-highest foreclosure rate in the country. But the Obama campaign has criticized the Clinton proposal as one that would dry up credit and exacerbate the current economic pain.</br></br>While Sen. Obama supports a foreclosure freeze, the Illinois senator hasn't made it an explicit part of his economic proposal. During a town hall in the Cleveland suburb of Parma Heights on Saturday, he suggested that the Bush administration's agreement last week with major lenders to freeze some foreclosures for 30 days was insufficient. ""We should give them the time that they need,"" he said.</br></br>The candidates disagree sharply on whether interest rates should be frozen on adjustable-rate mortgages. While many of the adjustable-rate mortgages will reset this year, before a new president is sworn in, their stances spotlight more fundamental differences about how each candidate might approach the economy."
"WASHINGTON -- For 10 months, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has kept his hands off the interest-rate lever.</br></br>When the recovery sputtered just before last November's election, Mr. Greenspan refused to cut short-term interest rates despite pleas from seven of the 12 regional Fed banks. When an inflation scare spooked the bond market earlier this year, Mr. Greenspan didn't raise rates -- although he probably would have had there been one more bad month of inflation news.</br></br>After listening to Mr. Greenspan's recent testimony before Congress, financial markets concluded that the chairman's fingers may be getting itchy. But the markets may not have been listening carefully.</br></br>Mr. Greenspan isn't nearly as hard to understand as some people say. Yes, his sentences are convoluted. Take this one: ""Patently, the overall economic effect of fiscal policy, especially when combined with the uncertainties of the forthcoming health-reform package, has imparted a number of unconventional unknowns to the economic outlook.""</br></br>But his current message is clear: The short-term interest rates that the Fed controls, adjusted for inflation, are near zero. In a growing economy, that is too low. The Fed is going to raise short-term interest rates one of these days. He didn't say when. He probably doesn't know when. The Fed will move sooner if inflation raises its ugly head. It will move later if inflation behaves."
"IRRATIONAL exuberance?</br></br>Make that uncontrollable, indefatigable, unreasonable, outlandish exuberance.</br></br>Before the market's great fall early this year, investors managed to convince themselves that this time was different, that stocks couldn't go down very much, or for very long if they did. Bolstered by this ill-advised overconfidence, lots of people did lots of things they no doubt wish they hadn't.</br></br>Turn back the clock, to the first quarter of this year. Investors who were content to settle for mutual funds and stocks with 10% to 20% annual returns were made to feel like, well, dullards. They just didn't get it.</br></br>The people who did get it were leaving their Old Economy jobs for the excitement and riches of dot-com-dom. Or, if they didn't go to work for Internet companies, they were working with Internet companies and getting a piece of the action by taking shares in lieu of cash for business they did. Now, much of that stock may be more valuable as wallpaper."
"The enormous cloud of uncertainty that has hung over the U.S. economy for the past five months began to dissipate last week when U.S. and allied forces attacked Iraq.</br></br>For better or worse, American households and businesses will soon know the outcome and can again make long-term plans accordingly. The invasion of Kuwait last August had produced a sort of paralysis of planning. Business executives in many industries said they were avoiding new long-term commitments wherever possible. Surveys showed that consumers cut back plans to buy new homes or cars or take vacations.</br></br>These effects, along with the real damage from soaring oil prices to consumers' pocketbooks and businesses' profits, battered an already weak U.S. economy and tipped it into a recession.</br></br>If the progress of the war and the reaction of the markets to that progress continue, there is a broad consensus that the economic outlook will have taken a decided turn for the better. The ifs remain big ones, but a swift end to the conflict would bring a double dividend to President Bush: It would insulate him from criticism over high casualties more likely from a longer war and the likely economic improvement would eliminate recession as a club in the hands of his political opponents.</br></br>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who before the attack had said the economy's slide was slowing, said last week's developments should make the recession both shorter and more shallow."

"Payday loans are meant as a stopgap for the fiscally pinched. But in many cases, these short-term loans create a costly cycle of escalating debt.</br></br>A payday loan is like a cash advance on your paycheck. Marketed as a temporary solution to a short-term setback like car repair or emergency medical issues, these loans are typically expected to be paid back in two weeks, the usual pay cycle.</br></br>But what happens, a recent study by the Pew Charitable Trusts found, is that most borrowers--some 69% of first-time borrowers--need the money not for a crisis but for everyday necessities. That leads to repeat loans.</br></br>""Payday loans are legalized loan sharking designed to get people into debt,"" says Kathleen Day, a spokeswoman for the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Responsible Lending. ""Why would lending to someone in financial straits at outrageous interest rates be considered a good thing?""</br></br>Amy Cantu, a spokeswoman for the Community Financial Services Association of America, the industry's Alexandria, Va.-based trade group, responds that ""consumers need a variety of credit options.""

"The Clinton administration, alarmed that the declining dollar threatens its hopes for the U.S. economy, led a 16-nation offensive to prop up the currency.</br></br>As Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen declared unequivocally for the first time that the dollar has fallen too far, the U.S. recruited allies ranging from Germany to Portugal to buy dollars in the most-coordinated show of force that currency markets have seen in a decade.</br></br>The intervention met with modest initial success, but the markets are sure to test the dollar again. And this will increase pressure on the Federal Reserve Board to further increase interest rates to shore up the currency. The dollar traded late yesterday at 1.6535 marks, up from 1.6368 the day before, and at 101.85 yen, up from 101.00.</br></br>In a clear and deliberate departure from past rhetoric, which described intervention as a response to ""disorderly"" markets and ""volatility,"" Mr. Bentsen said yesterday's moves ""reflect our view that recent movements in exchange markets have gone beyond what is justified by economic fundamentals."" Trying to dispel the notion that the U.S. wants to depreciate its currency to make its exports more attractive and to put pressure on Japan to agree to trade concessions, Mr. Bentsen said: ""This administration sees no advantage in an undervalued currency.""</br></br>Administration officials say that the markets have badly misread their dollar policy. The intervention is an effort to ""counteract a negative psychology that had developed in part on the false perception that the U.S. was trying to drive down the dollar for competitive reasons or that the U.S. was somehow indifferent to where market forces took the dollar,"" a senior Treasury official said yesterday. Of course, Mr. Bentsen himself contributed to all this back in February 1993, just after taking office, when he told a questioner that he would like to see a stronger yen. He has since been more careful, but other officials occasionally have reinforced the markets' impression that the administration favors a weak dollar. That view gained credence earlier this year when the Treasury failed to act to brake the dollar when it fell sharply against the yen."
"WASHINGTON -- Inflation eased a bit in November as consumer prices rose 0.3%, or at a 4.4% annual rate, the Labor Department said.</br></br>The price report came as the Commerce Department released its final calculation of the country's third-quarter economic growth, confirming that the economy during the period expanded at its slowest pace since the end of 1986.</br></br>The department estimated that the gross national product, the market value of all the goods and services produced in the U.S., grew at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 2.5% during the period. The figure was slightly lower than the previous estimate of 2.6%, a revision most economists said was insignificant.</br></br>On the surface, the two reports seemed to mitigate some fears that the economy is growing too rapidly to hold prices in line. The increase in consumer prices was lower than many analysts expected, and, to most, reinforced a Labor Department report Friday that showed wholesale prices in November rose only 0.3% as well.</br></br>Moreover, the third-quarter GNP expansion was significantly slower than in the first and second quarters, when GNP grew at 3.4% and 3.0% respectively."

"A decade ago, long before the financial calamity now sweeping the world, the federal government's economic brain trust heard a clarion warning and declared in unison: You're wrong.</br></br>The meeting of the President's Working Group on Financial Markets on an April day in 1998 brought together Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. -- all Wall Street legends, all opponents to varying degrees of tighter regulation of the financial system that had earned them wealth and power.</br></br>Their adversary, although also a member of the Working Group, did not belong to their club. Brooksley E. Born, the 57-year-old head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, had earned a reputation as a steely, formidable litigator at a high-powered Washington law firm. She had grown used to being the only woman in a room full of men. She didn't like to be pushed around.</br></br>Greenspan, Rubin and Levitt had reacted with alarm at Born's persistent interest in a fast-growing corner of the financial markets known as derivatives, so called because they derive their value from something else, such as bonds or currency rates. Setting the jargon aside, derivatives are both a cushion and a gamble -- deals that investment companies and banks arrange to manage the risk of their holdings, while trying to turn a profit at the same time.</br></br>Unlike the commodity futures regulated by Born's agency, many newer derivatives weren't traded on an exchange, constituting what some traders call the ""dark markets."" There were now millions of such private contracts, involving many of Wall Street's top firms. But there was no clearinghouse holding collateral to settle a deal gone bad, no transparent records of who was trading what."

"Since peaking in the second term of Ronald Reagan's presidency, spending on weapons by the Pentagon has been on a steady decline. In real terms, adjusted for inflation, spending on production of planes, ships, tanks and ammunition has fallen 70 percent since 1985.</br></br>This year, though, the Clinton administration is trying to reverse that slide, asking Congress in the president's recently released budget for the first real increase in defense procurement in 13 years. As the chart at the right shows, this reversal comes as the overall defense budget -- which includes spending for operations, maintenance and personnel in addition to weaponry -- is barely rising. When adjusted for inflation, it actually shows a 1 percent decline.</br></br>""It's certainly fair to say the deep cuts in procurement over the past 10 years are over,"" said Steven M. Kosiak, budget analyst at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments in Washington.</br></br>President Clinton's budget seeks $48.7 billion for new weaponry in fiscal 1999, up nearly 9 percent from $44.8 billion in the current year's budget. By 2000, the plan calls for $54.1 billion in procurement spending, and the number rises to $63.5 billion by 2003.</br></br>The spending shift can be attributed to the need to modernize many of the military's older weapons as well as the administration's desire to begin production of some 21st-century programs."

"Because unemployment has dropped and economic signs have turned more favorable, the Democratic candidates for president are being urged by political analysts, and even some of their own advisers, to downgrade the economy as a political issue and concentrate on foreign policy.</br></br>This would be a very big mistake. It assumes that voters are ready to forgive President Reagan for his ill-conceived Economic Recovery Program, that supply-side fantasy that sent the economy into a tailspin, idling 33 percent of the nation‰Ûªs productive capacity, driving unemployment up to 12 million, creating over $400 billion in deficits, boosting mortgage interest to 18 percent and, in the process, forcing cutbacks in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, food stamps and unemployment compensation.</br></br>That sort of polity, and the pall it cast over the economy until last summer, are not so quickly forgotten. The way Democrats can keep the issue alive is by pointing to the next four years. Long after the need for a shift in economic policy became imperative, Reagan was the one who insisted on ‰ÛÏstaying the course.‰Û So it is almost certain that, at the first sign of renewed inflation, a second Reagan administration would send the average American through the economic wringer again. All of those who lost their jobs before would be out on the street again.</br></br>If this does not have the makings of an effective election issue, I don‰Ûªt know one when I see it. With some of the best media experts in the country on their side, such as Norman Lear, David Sawyer, Tony Schwartz and Robert Squier, the Democrats can present the economic issue in countless and ingenious ways.</br></br>There is an even better reason for Democrats to stress the home front this year. The party out of power takes a real risk when it campaigns on foreign policy. An incumbent president controls both the initiative and the information in foreign policy. In his quiver are both arrows and olive branches."
"Federal Reserve officials raised a key interest rate again yesterday and signaled that they do not know whether they will need to move it still higher in coming months to prevent rapid economic growth from pushing inflation higher.</br></br>The policymakers suggested in a statement that they were keeping their options open, a message that disappointed many investors and analysts who had hoped for a clear sign that the Fed would pause in June and leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged after nearly two years of steady increases.</br></br>Stock prices fell sharply after the central bank's top policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee, announced its unanimous decision and issued a statement.

"State governments are borrowing heavily from the federal government to keep paying unemployment-insurance benefits and, even with the weak job market, most states are raising payroll taxes to pay off the loans.</br></br>Thirty one states, their unemployment-insurance funds empty, have borrowed nearly $41 billion from the federal government. California alone has borrowed nearly $8.8 billion as of mid-November, according to the Labor Department.</br></br>As states try to replenish the funds and begin to repay the loans, employers are facing increases in both state and federal payroll taxes, a potential barrier to new hiring.</br></br>""Employers were hit with these adjustments quite a bit last year,"" said Richard Hobbie, executive director for the National Association of State Workforce Agencies. A National Employment Law Project analysis found that 41 states increased unemployment-insurance payroll taxes this year by an average of nearly 33.9%. The largest was a 168.5% boost from 2009 in Hawaii.</br></br>Payroll taxes levied by states fund unemployment benefits for up to 26 weeks -- and longer in some states.

"New York-area financial exchanges and some of the city's large banking firms said they planned to open Monday, after Manhattan emerged from the storm largely unscathed.</br></br>But few expected a quick return to normal life.

But after a rainy night Saturday, the storm moved northward on Sunday having done little damage in Manhattan.</br></br>In most of Manhattan, including downtown, power was largely intact and there was minimal flooding. In Battery Park City, an area along the mouth of Hudson River that the mayor's office had ordered evacuated, residents were biking and jogging by lunchtime Sunday."
"WASHINGTON -- Large gains in personal income and consumer spending in September indicate that the economy probably will continue to grow at a moderate rate in coming months.</br></br>Personal income rose by a sturdy 0.9% during the month and consumer spending increased an even more robust 1.4%, the Commerce Department reported.That compares with income growth of 0.6% and flat consumption in August.</br></br>""These numbers should lay to rest for the time being any fears of recession,"" said Allen Sinai, chief economist for Shearson Lehman/American Express Inc.</br></br>The report, which follows two months of largely sluggish economic statistics, was good news for President Reagan, who has just 2 1/2 weeks left in his reelection campaign.</br></br>But the department's report wasn't all roses. A consumption-based inflation measure, which is reported with a one-month lag, showed that prices paid by consumers were rising at a 0.6% rate in both July and August. That suggests an annual inflation rate exceeding 7%."

"There are no sure things in the stock market. But one of the most reliable direction-finders is the so-called ""January effect.‰Û The phrase describes a theory of market behavior that states: ‰ÛÏStocks that fall in December will rise again in January.""</br></br>For the past four years, Bonnie Wachtel, vice president of Wachtel & Co. of Washington, has tested this seasonal trading strategy and found that it works. While it was tougher to make it work this year than last year, Wachtel said, the strategy worked well enough to bolster her belief in the January effect.</br></br>""Our strategy is intended to identify stocks that are likely to depressed at year-end from tax selling by investors, who-have substantial losses in those stocks,‰Û Wachtel ' said. ""We purchase shares in December and sell them in January, hopefully at a quick profit, when the selling pressure abates.""</br></br>During last December, Wachtel invested $24,625 in 10 depressed stocks. In January and early February, she sold the shares for a total of $29,625, a gain of $5,000 or 20 percent. During this same time period, the Dow Jones industrial average moved up 9 percent, putting the performance of her stocks far head of the blue chips.</br></br>When the commissions are included, the total cost of her shares rose to $25,325. And the sale brought her only $28,925. So her true profit was lowered to $3,600. And her return was reduced to 14 percent for a six-week investment."
"LONDON -- The firmer dollar helped boost Eurodollar bond prices 1/8 to 1/4 point, but the improvement wasn't enough to encourage much retail buying.</br></br>""It's definitely the stronger dollar,"" one dealer at a Swiss bank said, noting that the U.S. currency rose on the smaller-than-expected U.S. August trade deficit of $13.32 billion. The deficit, which was below the $18.04 billion initially reported for August and the revised $16.05 billion July trade gap, could herald stronger than expected U.S. third-quarter growth. But that had little impact on the currency-conscious Eurobond market, bond specialists said.</br></br>The dollar ""is where the primary focus is at the moment,"" one new-issue manager said.</br></br>With the West German central bank also providing early support for the U.S. currency, the dollar firmed in late trading against the mark.</br></br>U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said the shrinking of the August trade gap ""may be the turning point in our trade deficit"" and cited the drop in imports of manufactured goods, ""where the decline in the dollar may be taking hold."""
"Last year, Barbara Aultman gave up trying to sell her Indianapolis home and rented it instead.</br></br>""I wanted to be the best landlady on the face of the earth,"" recalls Ms. Aultman, a community-development specialist.

"It's no secret that the tea party faithful regard the Obama administration as a Constitution-shredding tyranny.

"GOODBYE, WASHINGTON. Hello, Wall Street.</br></br>I am not a political columnist, and I have no desire to argue over the merits of privatizing Social Security.

"Telecom bankers have a lot to answer for. In the past year, the industry's two big U.S. initial public offerings of stock have been disastrous. The shares of Vonage Holdings and Clearwire have plummeted 80% and 25%, respectively, since their debuts.</br></br>Now, bankers are shopping the largest telecom IPO since 2004. Luckily for them -- and prospective investors -- the $1 billion float of discount cellphone operator MetroPCS looks like a winner.</br></br>Metro is a pygmy competing against giants, but that isn't necessarily bad. Competition among the big cellphone operators is relatively restrained. It tends to revolve around which flashy new handset is offered along with a standard multiyear contract. In contrast, Metro sells cheap, unlimited cellphone service to customers on a monthly basis for a flat fee.</br></br>This has worked out well. Metro's revenues have increased about 60% in each of the past five years. But growth rates aren't everything, as Vonage and Clearwire have demonstrated. Profitability is the key. And it remains only a vague promise for those two companies. Metro, by contrast, has turned a profit for the past four years -- and its earnings have paid for a majority of its growth.</br></br>Moreover, the price it's seeking looks reasonable. At $20, the midpoint of the indicated range, the stock will be valued at less than 16 times estimated 2007 EBITDA (earnings before taxes, depreciation and other factors). This is slightly more than Leap Wireless, a similar business. But Metro is likely to grow faster because its licenses cover a greater proportion of the population."

"Try talking about the stock market without mentioning the Dow Jones Industrial Average: It is a little like talking about the weather without mentioning the temperature.</br></br>It wasn't always that way. For the first 25 years or so of its existence, the industrial average was mostly absent from headlines in the financial press.</br></br>In the late 19th century and early 20th century, investors focused mainly on the action of individual stock issues rather than the market as a whole. When they did look at market averages, they were more likely to look at railroad stocks, the blue chips of the day, than at industrial stocks, which were considered speculations.</br></br>It was in the Roaring '20s that many investors first became intimately acquainted with the industrial average. That was when masses of average citizens began buying stocks by the bundle. Their enthusiasm carried the industrial average from around 100 in 1924 to nearly 400 by mid-1929.</br></br>Then, the crash of 1929 thrust the Dow industrials to true prominence. Investors were hungry for a way to gauge the overall damage, so the Dow industrials made front-page headlines."

"Virginia Gov. Timothy M. Kaine (D) has recommended changes to legislation passed by the General Assembly that environmentalists had feared would cripple a popular land conservation program.</br></br>The bill was part of a compromise between the House of Delegates and the Senate, which concluded months of feuding and passed a state budget last month. As passed by the General Assembly, the measure repealed Virginia's estate tax and paid for the tax break by imposing a cap of $50 million in 2007 and $75 million in 2008 on tax credits given to landowners who agreed to preserve open space.</br></br>Senators had argued that the popular tax credit program needed the caps because it was costing the state many millions more than predicted. House leaders and conservationists countered that the program's popularity was proof that it was helping Virginia to save acreage from development.</br></br>The amendments would impose a $100 million cap and allow the cap to rise over time with inflation. Kaine also would remove a provision to give preferential treatment to landowners in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.</br></br>Christopher G. Miller, president of the Piedmont Environmental Council, called the governor's amendments ""a substantial improvement."""

"Google, the popular Internet search engine, offers a page called Google News, a summary of what's going on in the world produced entirely by computers. Well, I say ""entirely,"" but Google's computers don't actually gather the news. What they do is scan thousands of other Web pages and, using a secret formula, decide what the top stories are. Then they cleverly lift headlines and other material from different news sources, add links to these and other sites, and come up with what appears to be the Web site of an extremely cosmopolitan newspaper.</br></br>It's slightly a bluff. Who knows why the computers chose to feature a New Zealand news site the other day as a way of covering the Miss World imbroglio in Nigeria? But you have to suspect that the explanation lies in the crudeness of the computer's judgment, not its sophistication. Google concedes that its choices of stories and news sources are ""occasionally unusual and contradictory,"" but insists with uncharacteristic pomposity, ""it is exactly this variety that makes Google News a valuable source of information on the important issues of the day.""</br></br>Which is humbug. People still do it better. But not by much. The day is clearly approaching when editors can be replaced by computers. This requires some urgent rethinking.</br></br>Throughout the revolution of technology and globalization that has been going on for two decades, responsible mainstream commentators, pundits, analysts and miscellaneous gasbags (including this one) have taken the view that progress is a good thing. Some people are unfortunately caught in the gears of change, but society as a whole benefits. It's not very complicated if you know a bit of economics. You've got your ""invisible hand"" (that's free markets), you've got your ""comparative advantage"" (that's free trade), you've got your ""perennial gale of creative destruction"" (that's competition and new technology), you've got your ""can't make an omelet without breaking eggs"" (that's attributed to Joseph Stalin, but never mind). The losers in this process deserve sympathy and help, but special pleading must not be allowed to thwart or slow this process.</br></br>We must distinguish, however, between special pleading and legitimate alarm about deeply troubling developments. It is one thing to sacrifice textile workers and auto workers on the altar of progress. It is quite another to start throwing journalists into the flames. And the difference is? Well, it's very different. Completely different. Couldn't be more different, quite frankly, my good madam, because . . . because . . . well, it occurs to me that I'm a journalist.

"NEW YORK, April 11‰ÛÓThe stock market moved broadly lower today, its retreat accelerating during the day as skeptical investors questioned whether interest rates were headed lower.</br></br>Retail stocks fell in advance of Thursday‰Ûªs government report on March sales, and drug and technology issues were prominent among the losers.

"YOUR CASH is no longer trash.</br></br>Thanks to a string of 16 consecutive Federal Reserve interest-rate increases since June 2004, investors have been earning substantially more on their money. In recent weeks, yields on some money-market mutual funds and short-term Treasury bills have crossed 5% -- their highest levels since 2001. That follows earlier moves by some banks to boost yields on certificates of deposit past 5%.</br></br>After a number of years in which historically low interest rates caused investors to overlook cash -- if not shun it outright -- Wall Street is once again treating it as a serious option, as are individual investors, who are pouring money into it. And higher yields aren't the only lure. Stocks have swooned in recent weeks, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 199 points yesterday, and investors have grown skittish about inflation and higher interest rates and their effect on stock and bond returns.</br></br>Yesterday the government issued a new batch of six-month Treasury bills paying 5%. Money-market mutual funds managed by Morgan Stanley and the asset-management division of Credit Suisse, a unit of Credit Suisse Group, began paying 5% late last month. These funds are primarily geared to pension funds and institutions, although some high-net-worth investors may get access to them through their advisers or private bank.</br></br>If the Federal Reserve raises short-term interest rates from the current 5% when it meets later this month -- as Chairman Ben Bernanke has signaled he may well do -- then many of the retail money-market funds open to small investors are likely to cross the 5% threshold within weeks. That is because the rates on money-market funds, which invest in short-term debt, are determined by market rates. If the Fed declines to raise rates, then yields on money-market funds are likely to stall out just under 5%, says Peter Crane, publisher of Money Fund Intelligence."
"[Today's Market Forecast]</br></br>A Chill Wind</br></br>With the Fed set to push up interest rates for the first time in over four years today, one little fact may have eluded many investors: The economy's growth rate already seems to be slowing down.</br></br>Start with consumer spending. When the Commerce Department released May spending figures Monday, it revised down its read on real personal consumption in April. This came hand in hand with warnings of slower June sales from General Motors, Wal-Mart Stores and Target, which account for about one-tenth of U.S. retail sales.</br></br>In the wake of the surprisingly strong consumer-confidence reading yesterday, some may see this as a mere blip. But there is further evidence of sluggishness. Tucked inside of last week's generally dismal May durable-goods report were unexpected declines in capital- equipment shipments and orders."
"NEW YORK -- With Canada's constitutional crisis near the boiling point, the Canadian dollar runs the risk of losing some of its most loyal supporters in recent years: the Japanese.</br></br>Because of persistently high Canadian interest rates, traders say, the Japanese have faithfully helped rescue the Canadian dollar during hard times in the past -- even when those high rates started to upset the economy. In the bond market Friday, the 10-year Canadian government bond yielded 10.67%, well above the 8.44% yield on the equivalent U.S. Treasury issue.</br></br>But some currency specialists say Canada's rates might lose some of their appeal if the nation's political scene gets any stormier. Manitoba and Newfoundland have yet to approve the so-called Meech Lake accord that all 10 Canadian provinces must ratify by Saturday. The accord, negotiated three years ago at Meech Lake, Quebec, would recognize Quebec as a ""distinct society"" within Canada. Quebec has threatened to secede if the pact doesn't pass.</br></br>If the worst-case scenario is borne out and Quebec announces a quest for independence, knee-jerk sales are expected to jolt all of Canada's financial markets.</br></br>In the case of Japanese investment, however, more worrisome is the possibility that capital flow from Japan will dry up over the long run, leaving the Canadian dollar particularly vulnerable, some analysts say."

The 80% positive response was up sharply from the 70% who held that view in a similar Harris poll last year.</br></br>But some other findings indicate many Americans still think of the big banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions that make up ""Wall Street"" as a kingdom populated by large numbers of ethical pygmies.</br></br>For example, a majority of those surveyed agreed that ""most people on Wall Street would be willing to break the law if they believed they could make a lot of money and get away with it."" A majority also agreed that Wall Street is ""dominated by greed and selfishness.""</br></br>On the bright side, fewer people subscribed to either of these opinions than only a year ago. And the majority of those surveyed also believe that Wall Streeters generally are just as honest and moral as other people."
"IT'S TIME for George Bush to revive an old romance. Nineteen years ago, when he had just lost a Senate race in Texas, Bush was looking for work. Come to the White House as congressional liaison, suggested Richard Nixon, who had encouraged the Texas race. No thanks, said Bush, uninterested in a staff job. Well, how about the United Nations? Okay, said Bush, and with that he launched an international career that put him on the road to the presidency.</br></br>But what did Bush himself want in those days? Sources from the Nixon White House say that he had an entirely different path in mind, far from diplomacy and maybe even politics. His first choice was a top post at the Treasury Department, drawing upon his days as an oilman and as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Bush hoped that Nixon would eventually make him secretary of the treasury, where he could spruce up the American economy.</br></br>Though he hasn't been a close student of the economy since then, Bush could now serve both himself and the country if he returned to his old interest in economic affairs. Not this week, nor this month, but by fall, he should come to the country with a giant plan for economic renewal. For both Bush and the economy, this is an ideal time to strike.</br></br>Over the past four weeks, Bush has vaulted into his strongest political position since taking office. His arms proposal in Europe not only transformed his first serious trip overseas but seemed to liberate him from a cautious past. Since then he has put together a string of successes: his deft handling of the China crisis, a clean-air proposal, blockage of a minimum-wage proposal and House passage of most of his S&L bailout plan. A Gallup Poll taken in early June showed his popularity climbing 14 points to a 70 percent approval rating-and that was before his call for cleaner air, a sure winner. After a dangerously slow start, Bush may now begin a second honeymoon.</br></br>By chance, the president has seized the high ground just as Congress is falling off the charts in public esteem, badly damaged by the uproar over ethics, pay and unprecedented resignations. While the Democrats have now elected stronger House leaders, they are likely to be far more conciliatory than anyone imagined six months ago. Reagan was more formidable than Bush in his first year, but he could never fully reverse the post-Vietnam flow of power away from the White House. Bush just might-if he now moves to set a more ambitious agenda."

"NEW YORK -- The dollar leapt higher Wednesday -- particularly against European currencies -- propelled by President Clinton's call for the Deutsche Bundesbank to lower German interest rates.</br></br>The remarks had extra impact because the foreign exchange market is bullish on the U.S. currency and was experiencing end-of-the-month thinness, traders said.</br></br>Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.7035 marks, up from 1.6885 marks late Tuesday in New York.

"WASHINGTON -- The Senate approved a $57 billion-plus agriculture spending bill that would restore money for President Clinton's food-safety initiative and provide $500 million in emergency aid for hardpressed farmers.</br></br>The Midwest and Texas are two likely beneficiaries of the farm aid, which sailed through on a voice vote and the endorsement of the White House. After days of pounding by Democrats on a growing economic crisis in the Farm Belt, Republican senators appeared to have little will to resist. Even on the food-safety initiative, the GOP split almost evenly in support of the White House's position.</br></br>Sen. Thad Cochran (R., Miss.), the bill's manager, joined in backing the amendment, adding $66 million for the food-safety program. Most of the money would go to programs within the Food and Drug Administration, and together with what was already in the bill, the White House will get a total of $68 million, or about three-quarters of its request.</br></br>Final Senate passage last night came as the House narrowly approved a $26.6 billion Treasury bill after a seesaw battle driven by partisan politics -- and the always divisive issue of abortion. Attached to the measure is a precedent-setting provision requiring that health-insurance plans for federal employees provide contraceptive coverage.</br></br>Antiabortionists have attached similar riders to ban abortion coverage, and the new provision is a major victory for women's rights groups. Beyond the abortion debate, the proposal touches on the issue of gender discrimination in health insurance. Young single women are often forced to bear the price of birth control, and if the contraceptives requirement is enacted for federal-employee health plans, it could have an influence on the entire health-insurance industry."

The 2009 forecast was slashed from 3.9% to 3%, which would be the weakest level since 2002 and near the threshold of what the IMF considers a global recession.</br></br>While the IMF still expects a recovery to begin late next year, it warned there are ""considerable downside risks"" to that scenario, which assumes U.S. and European governments will succeed in their efforts to stabilize markets."
"WASHINGTON -- The U.S. trade deficit could swell to as much as $160 billion this year, resulting in additional layoffs in manufacturing industries, the Commerce Department predicted.</br></br>In its midyear trade outlook, the department noted that a robust U.S. economy compensated for similar job losses in 1982 and 1983 by creating 7.3 million new jobs. But with slower growth this year, the department forecast, the continuing stream of imports could hurt employment and lead to larger foreign shares of the markets for cars, telecommunication equipment and other products.</br></br>The department calculated the 1985 deficit to be in the range of $140 billion to $160 billion. The larger end was bigger than Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige's earlier forecast that the deficit will hit $150 billion this year.</br></br>The department cautioned that its latest outlook doesn't signal any change in the administration's policy of resisting legislation designed to curb imports or retaliate harshly against trading partners. Its report noted that foreign restrictions against U.S. exports are only one of several causes of the deficit.</br></br>The document also cited the strong dollar, import cutbacks by highly indebted countries, a narrowing U.S. technological edge and the continuing strength of the U.S. economy compared with that of other industrialized nations."

"The arbiter of when U.S. economic recessions begin and end, the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research, has laid the groundwork for calling an official end to the slump that began in March 2001.</br></br>It could be weeks or months before that happens, but the committee has found a way around the fact that its key monthly indicator, payroll employment, has continued to decline long after the economy resumed growing.</br></br>The committee designated March 2001 as the beginning of the recession primarily because that was when the number of payroll jobs began to drop, a decline of 2.6 million so far.</br></br>If the committee were to rely on the same indicator to date the end of the slump, the recession would already have lasted for two years and three months, making it the longest since the vastly more serious downturn that began in 1929 and became the Great Depression.</br></br>Until the 2001 recession, the employment number and other indicators used by the committee have done a generally good job of tracking the rise and fall of the nation's economic output. This time, however, changes in payroll employment have not been a good proxy for economic growth, because productivity -- the amount of goods and services produced for each hour worked -- has continued to increase through the economy's contraction in 2001 and sluggish expansion since. That has allowed companies to increase production while cutting their workforces."
"Americans are borrowing more to pay for college while reducing other debt as a weak job market prompts more people to go to school and tuition keeps climbing, new Federal Reserve Bank of New York data show.</br></br>Americans owed $904 billion in student loans at the end of March, nearly 8% more than a year ago, the New York Fed said Thursday in a quarterly report on consumer credit.

"As the Dow Jones industrial average hurtles toward 10,000, putting journalists in a quandary about whether to use a comma, investors are pouring more and more money into mutual funds -- a record $37.5 billion in net new cash in March. In 1980, fund investments totaled $100 billion in 12 million accounts; today, $5 trillion in 170 million accounts.</br></br>Still, the majority of Americans have exactly zero dollars invested in the stock market. Some of them simply don't have the money, but many others are confused and scared, and don't know where to begin. They think they need special expertise, and they worry about being burned by unscrupulous brokers or stock manipulators. That's a shame, considering how easy it has become to own stocks and how fair and efficient our markets are.</br></br>The best way to get into the stock market is to buy shares in an equity mutual fund, which is a portfolio of stocks chosen by a professional manager. When you own a share in a fund, you own pieces of all the stocks in the portfolio. While I think it's a good idea to own three or four funds, it's possible -- even prudent -- to own just one. But which fund? That is this week's question, both for investment novices and for more seasoned mavens who want to ponder an interesting intellectual question.</br></br>Here is what I want in just-one-fund: relatively low risk; broad exposure to stocks, including at least a few international ones; strong, consistent performance; and a seasoned manager. I'd like to beat the market, but with few unsettling dips. The ideal fund would not be too big. New research from Morningstar Mutual Funds shows that returns decline as oversized large-cap funds (but, curiously, not small-cap funds) grow to behemoths. Also, expenses should be reasonable, and turnover (which boosts tax bills) should be relatively low.</br></br>One of the few funds that meets these criteria is Dreyfus Disciplined Stock (1-800-645-6561), which has two of my favorite words in its title. The manager, Bert Mullins, has been running the fund since it began 10 years ago under the aegis of Mellon Bank Corp., a conservative Pittsburgh-based institution that merged recently with Dreyfus. Mellon had only a few funds, which were excellent but poorly marketed. Dreyfus had lots of funds, many of which were not stellar performers but were brilliantly sold. It was a match made in Wall Street heaven."

"A coalition of labor and civil rights leaders gathered at Freedom Plaza yesterday to denounce the Bush administration's efforts to turn more federal work over to the private sector.</br></br>Between chants of ""No privatization!"" by members of federal unions, speakers contended that the administration's competitive sourcing initiative would take federal jobs away from minorities, women and veterans and weaken a civil service that protects the integrity of federal programs for all Americans.</br></br>""We perform our jobs in the public interest, not in the interest of profits or to promote any political agenda,"" Leora Rosen, a social science analyst at the Justice Department, told the crowd.</br></br>President Bush has said agencies should compete with companies for as many as 850,000 government jobs that are considered commercial in nature. The administration says it does not care who wins the right to perform the jobs because the competition will drive agencies to become more efficient and lower costs.</br></br>Directives from the Office of Management and Budget for agencies to put up half of their commercial jobs for bid over the next few years have roiled the federal workforce and created morale problems in some agencies. OMB hopes to issue streamlined rules for job competitions in the next few weeks, but the new procedures seem unlikely to ease employee concerns."
"Health-care premiums paid by employers and their workers rose again in 2008, though more slowly than in recent years, and more employees grappled with deductibles of $1,000 and higher, a nationwide survey showed.</br></br>The average premium rose 5% in 2008, according to an annual poll of nearly 2,000 employers by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust. The widely watched barometer of health-care costs, released Wednesday, does offer some faint consolation: The increase wasn't much changed from last year's and a far cry from the 13% to 14% increase of five years ago.</br></br>Another large employer survey released Wednesday, by employee- benefits consultancy Towers Perrin, projected a 6% rise in premiums for 2009. That is in line with a survey by Hewitt Associates earlier this week, which predicted a 6.4% increase in companies' health-care costs next year.</br></br>Consumers are struggling with record health-care costs -- which have climbed at several times the rate of inflation and wage increases for the past decade -- just as they face a barrage of economic pressures, from declining retirement-savings accounts to higher energy and food prices. The annual cost of an average family health plan rose to $12,680 this year, more than double the $5,791 it cost in 1999, according to the Kaiser survey. Workers' annual contributions to those premiums have also more than doubled, to $3,354 in 2008 from $1,543 in 1999.</br></br>What's more, employees are taking on an increasingly greater share of health-care spending beyond premiums. The biggest shift in costs has come in the form of rising deductibles. About 18% of all workers with some kind of health coverage face deductibles of at least $1,000, up from 12% in 2007."

"The breaking-off of budget negotiations between President Reagan and congressional leaders yesterday leaves the nation facing a string of huge budget deficits and continuing high interest rates, with little chance for a sustained economic recovery anytime soon.</br></br>Congress still could find some way to reduce the deficits. But, in the absence of major spending cuts and tax increases, interest rates are likely to stay so high that the important, housing and auto industries almost certainly will remain deeply depressed, according to a number of economists. The high rates also probably will lead businesses to keep cutting back their capital investment plans, the key to healthy, longterm economic growth.</br></br>Murray L. Weidenbaum, Reagan‰Ûªs chief economist, recently said that even the $56 billion worth of spending cuts and revenue-raising measures proposed in the president‰Ûªs February budget are not regarded as large enough to relieve pressures in financial markets and bring interest rates down. There will be ‰ÛÏa slower, less robust recovery‰Û if there is no budget accord, he said. .</br></br>POLICY, From A1 mann, an economist at Morgan Stanley & Co., a New York investment banking firm, said last week that in the absence of ‰ÛÏa significant change in the budgetary trend currently in prospect... we expect that any drops in interest rates will be shortlived, which should serve effectively to limit the scope of economic expansion this year and next.‰Û</br></br>One of the few points on which the administration and congressional negotiators agreed was that, without tax increases or further spending cuts, the 1983 deficit likely would be about $180 billion, and that figure assumed that the economy would begin growing at about a 4 percent annual 'rate at mid-year.

During the 1998 Asian economic crisis, BASF snapped up chemical producers in Korea and speeded up construction of huge chemical complexes in Malaysia and China. Earlier this year, Mr. Strube flouted the furor in Europe over genetically modified crops by launching a 700 million euro ($664 million) research blitz in plant biotechnology. Then, raising the ante, BASF shelled out $3.8 billion for the agrochemical division of American Home Products Corp.</br></br>This week, Mr. Strube is pitching an Old Economy story to investors besotted with the New Economy. BASF stock begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange today.</br></br>It's the kind of challenge Mr. Strube savors.

"In his weekly radio address on Saturday, President Barack Obama said that ""we cannot allow the thirst for reckless schemes that produce quick profits and fat executive bonuses to override the security of our entire financial system and leave taxpayers on the hook for cleaning up the mess."" A day earlier, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner told the New York Times that ""you don't want people being paid for taking too much risk.""</br></br>So now the administration wants to control the pay of employees of banks and Wall Street investment firms.</br></br>Kenneth Feinberg, the administration's ""pay czar,"" is being tasked to oversee employee compensation at firms that took bailout money from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The Federal Reserve will require thousands of bank holding companies and state banks to submit their compensation plans for approval.</br></br>The administration has it wrong. It wasn't reckless schemes and excessive risk that sunk banks and Wall Street; it was excessive leverage. And thanks to cheap money and twisty regulations, risk was extremely undervalued. Banks owned huge portfolios of real-estate loans and mortgages specifically because they, and regulators, didn't think they were taking much risk at all.</br></br>Populist pay limits are squarely aimed at Wall Street, not local banks, yet for the most part Wall Street doesn't take much risk. Highly profitable investment banking and sales and trading are agency businesses, doing work for customers for a fee. Of course bad trades happen, and there are the rare rogue traders like Barings' Nick Leeson, who hid losses and sunk the firm, or Jerome Kerviel, the young trader who lost $7 billion for the French bank Societe Generale. But Wall Street firms are quite good at managing day-to-day trading risk."
"NEW YORK -- Until last week, Edward Yardeni of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. had been expecting a recession in the first half of this year. ""A slump is still possible,"" he says, ""but now we feel more comfortable with a muddling-through scenario.""</br></br>Mr. Yardeni had been more pessimistic than most economists; few analysts expected an actual recession this year. But many forecasters are beginning to wonder if their earlier predictions weren't a shade too gloomy. Recent statistics -- notably, employment, new orders and industrial production -- indicate the new year may be getting off to a faster-than-expected start.</br></br>""The strong employment gains in January show that the economic rebound has developed a good deal of momentum,"" says Sam Nakagama, a New York-based economic consultant. Non-farm payroll employment rose a sharp 448,000 last month after increasing 225,000 in December.</br></br>Robert Genetski, an economist at Chicago's Harris Trust & Savings Bank, says, ""The latest economic numbers show a burst of activity toward year end. In the final three months of the year, industrial production, personal income and wages and salaries rose at close to a 6% annual rate. Perhaps of greater significance is the surge in manufacturers' new orders, which suggests future strength. In December these orders, excluding defense, jumped 10% from their levels of last summer and fall.""</br></br>Mr. Genetski expects the inflation-adjusted gross national product to grow at a 3.6% annual rate in the current quarter, a sharp rise from the 1.7% rate in the fourth quarter. Other factors influencing Mr. Genetski and other optimists: rapid growth of the money supply, a belief that the trade deficit will continue to shrink, and the help that higher oil prices will give the U.S. oil industry."
"The Dow industrials vaulted past another milestone as stocks closed above 16000 for the first time, extending a record run fueled by optimism for a recovering global economy and continuing low interest rates.</br></br>The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average has now set 40 all-time highs in 2013 and is up 22% for the year. The index rose 109.17 points, or 0.7%, to a new high of 16009.99 on Thursday.</br></br>The advance has been broad-based but strongest among those companies with consumer-focused businesses whose recent cost-cutting efforts are seen as giving them an edge on rivals.</br></br>Airplane manufacturer Boeing Co. is up 76% this year, and apparel company Nike Inc., which was added to the index in September, is up 51%. Only two Dow components are down this year. Caterpillar Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. have declined 8.4% and 3.9%, respectively.</br></br>Stocks' record run comes amid a steady U.S. economic recovery along with the extraordinary easy-money policies of the Federal Reserve. Many investors say the Fed's bond-buying actions are helping the economy by keeping interest rates low and making stocks look more attractive compared with bonds and other investments."
"A burst of higher inflation is fueling debate about whether the Federal Reserve should move sooner to reduce its support for the U.S. economy than currently anticipated.</br></br>Consumer prices rose 0.4% in May from a month earlier, the most in more than a year, the Labor Department said. That reflected higher household costs for everything from groceries and gasoline to rent and medical care. Core prices, which strip out volatile food and energy costs, climbed 0.3%, the most since August 2011.</br></br>Tuesday's report showed the overall consumer-price index up 2.1% from a year earlier.</br></br>The Fed targets annual inflation of 2%, a pace it views as healthy for price stability and economic growth. But the central bank prefers a separate measure -- the Commerce Department's price index for personal consumption expenditures -- that has shown less-dramatic price increases and inflation still running below its target, at 1.6% in April.</br></br>Still, both measures suggest inflation picked up in the spring after two years of sluggishness."

The forecast portrays ""a broad-based economic expansion ... while inflation remains subdued,"" she said.</br></br>The administration's mid-year economic forecast predicts that the economy will grow 3 percent in the last three months of this year, compared with the same period in 1993, and that inflation during the same period will be stable at 3 percent.</br></br>Yesterday's report, an update of the administration's January predictions, took into account changing employment and interest rate data but did not contain much that is new or surprising, analysts said.</br></br>""Basically, the forecast is very much as it was before,"" Robert Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust Corp. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview yesterday.

"I would like to thank Messrs. Culver, Scott and Hawn (Letters to the Editor, Nov. 10) for the opportunity to correct several of their common misunderstandings about fuel grade ethanol.</br></br>Dave Culver, in his concern over the projected production cost of ethanol, makes no mention of the true costs of imported oil. When externalities such as environmental and health costs, the loss of domestic jobs and basic industries, the trade deficit, commitments of military resources to ensure the free flow of oil from the Middle East and threats to our energy and national security are included, the true cost of imports even now exceeds $100/bbl, according to the General Accounting Office.</br></br>Mr. Culver is off by a factor of almost 10 in his claim that ""Vehicles that consume a 10% mixture of `gasohol' typically see a 20% loss in fuel mileage."" Between 2% and 4% is correct. He is a bit closer in his description of E-85 vehicles. At this time, they experience about a 20% reduction in range compared to gasoline. That will improve with higher compression ratio engines allowed by ethanol's 113 octane. He is just flat wrong about fires and fuel system incompatibility with ethanol.</br></br>John W. Scott is correct in warning that the production of ethanol and other biofuels from feed grains and oilseeds, from agriculture and forestry residues, fast growing trees and grasses and well as from urban biomass heading for the dump, must ensure environmental integrity from the dirt to the tailpipe. The sloshing down the river of 15 gallons of top soil for every gallon of ethanol simply does not occur with modern, environmentally sound farming practices including crop rotation, conservation tillage, planting and harvesting, filter strips and the scientific use of agricultural chemicals. As the nation commercializes the conversion of ethanol and other biofuels from cellulosic biomass, the planting of grasses and trees on erodible land will bring increasing levels of top soil to farm lands, a process already well under way.</br></br>Richard G. Hawn needs to visit Brazil to verify his claims of poor-running cars and double-the-size gas tanks. Essentially all cars in Brazil run on ethanol, either in blends of 22% ethanol/78% gasoline or 99% ethanol (a little touch of denaturant to keep the imbibers away). They run well and the public is pleased. The fuel tanks are about 20% larger than they would be if straight gasoline were used. He is right about the Btu content of ethanol being lower than gasoline -- 76,000 Btu compared with about 119,000 for gasoline. But he neglected to mention that the increased thermal efficiency of ethanol when combusted and its much higher octane permits engine designs that will almost remove the Btu advantage of gasoline. He also failed to mention that air quality in San Paulo Brazil, with a population of 14 million, is better than in Los Angeles, New York City or Houston Texas. There are, of course, ""externalities"" in this observation -- and I will show mine when the oil companies show theirs."
"Most mutual funds lagged the market in the turbulent second quarter, with international funds finishing on top and utility funds on the bottom of the performance scale.</br></br>The average general equity fund gained 1.63%, falling short of the 5.02% advance in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, with dividends reinvested, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc. It was the fifth consecutive quarter that the average fund trailed the broad market measure.</br></br>Many fixed-income funds slid into negative territory for the first time since the second quarter of 1984, following violent bond-price swings during the spring. Gold funds fell back sharply from their top spot in the first quarter, as precious-metals fervor cooled along with fears of rising inflation. Lipper ranks 1,278 funds in 20 categories.</br></br>For the first six months, the average general equity fund logged a gain of 21.09%, compared with an increase of 27.44% for the S&P 500.</br></br>The second quarter's top fund was Dreyfus Strategic Aggressive Investing. It led the pack by capitalizing on the market's volatility through the use of stock-index futures and options, netting a gain of 42.51% in its start-up quarter. Bringing up the rear was Strategic Capital Gains. The fund, run by Dallas-based Strategic Management, bet heavily on a troubled oil-technology company -- and dropped 20.42%."
"Jeffrey Kindler, who stepped down as Pfizer Inc.'s chief executive on Sunday, citing burnout, is the rare CEO to say that the job wore him out.</br></br>In fact, occupying the high-powered cocoon known as the corner office is more stressful than ever, thanks to a greater emphasis on globalization, stiffer competition, heightened government regulation and the weak economic recovery, say former CEOs, corporate directors and management experts.</br></br>Compared with four years ago, pressures on CEOs ""are substantially different -- especially in certain industries,"" said Steve Reinemund, who retired in 2006 as PepsiCo Inc. CEO ""It's still pretty tough out there,"" adds Mr. Reinemund, dean of Wake Forest University's business school.</br></br>As a result, many CEOs now look at the corporate throne ""as a position with a limited term of office,"" said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a senior associate dean at Yale University's School of Management. ""They rarely seek to stay a minute more than a dignified decade.""</br></br>To cope, a few CEOs cut short their tenure. The head of a mid-sized mutual insurance company intended to retire in early 2013 after serving since 1999. But during a board succession-planning session three years ago, this chief announced he felt ""frankly burned out"" and wanted to leave within a year, said Beverly Behan, a New York corporate-governance consultant. ""It was the most emotional board meeting I had ever been in,"" she added."
"WASHINGTON -- When Ben Bernanke was nominated to head the Federal Reserve in 2005, he promised to ""maintain continuity with the policies and policy strategies established during the Greenspan years."" But in handling his first financial crisis, Mr. Bernanke shows signs of a break with Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman from 1987 to 2006.</br></br>That shift is important in understanding why Mr. Bernanke hasn't cut the Fed's main interest rate yet, and it could alter investors' expectations of how the Bernanke Fed will function.</br></br>The Fed historically has had two major economic duties. Maintaining financial stability is one. Controlling inflation while preventing recession is the other.</br></br>To Mr. Greenspan, market confidence and the economy's growth prospects were so intertwined as to make the Fed's two duties almost inseparable. He cut rates after the 1987 stock-market crash and the near-collapse of hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in 1998 to prevent investor reluctance to take risks from undermining the nation's economic growth.</br></br>By contrast, Mr. Bernanke distinguishes between the central bank's two functions. So, on Aug. 17, the Fed cut the interest rate and lengthened the term on loans to banks from its little-used discount window in hopes banks would use the window -- or at least the knowledge it was available -- to lend to solid borrowers having trouble getting credit amidst the market turmoil. The action was aimed at restoring the normal functioning of disrupted credit markets, not primarily at boosting growth."
"NEW YORK -- The dollar continued its southward path yesterday, dragged down sharply against the mark and the yen by persistent concerns about U.S. and Latin American asset markets and the direction of U.S. interest rates.</br></br>Systemic risk within the U.S. financial sector again weighed on the minds of nervous investors as falling banking stocks led Wall Street into yet another nosedive.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 7632.53, down 210.09 points, while the flight into U.S. government bonds pushed down the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue to a 4.875%, the lowest level for long-term bonds since June 1967.</br></br>Meanwhile, the Bovespa index fell 9.6% in Brazil, where fears of a devaluation in the local currency, the real, are intensifying ahead of this weekend's presidential election.</br></br>As went U.S. and regional stocks, so went the dollar. It fell to another 19-month low against the mark and gave up about half the gains it posted Wednesday against the yen."
"New-home sales fell but orders for durable goods rose in September, according to two government reports released Wednesday that show the economy remains on a wobbly path upward.</br></br>Sales of new homes fell 3.6% in September as the effect of the federal government's tax credit for first-time home buyers faded, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. A separate Commerce report showed that orders for big-ticket items such as cars and washing machines increased 1% in September and that a key measure of business spending rose, suggesting consumer demand and business confidence are inching back.</br></br>The recovery thus far has been heavily supported by federal money, casting a question mark over the economy's underlying strength as government support dwindles. A better picture of the economy's health comes Thursday, when third-quarter gross domestic product is released. Economists forecast growth of about 3% after four consecutive quarters of contraction.</br></br>The increase in orders for durable goods -- products designed to last more than three years -- was the second in three months. Orders of so-called core durable goods, a category that excludes orders for civilian planes and defense capital goods, also returned to growth, increasing 0.5% in September after a 0.4% drop in August.</br></br>Businesses continued to reduce their inventories of durable goods, but have eased up from the deep reductions over the past few months. Inventories decreased 1% in September, slower than the 1.5% pace in August. ""While inventories will continue to decline in the months ahead, the rate of liquidation is likely to moderate,"" Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at research firm MFR Inc., wrote in a note to clients."
"Negotiations to sell Electronic Data Systems Corp.'s A.T. Kearney management-consulting unit collapsed after the sole bidder withdrew.</br></br>Monitor Group, a Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm, said two months of analysis and talks couldn't produce a deal acceptable to Monitor, EDS and Kearney partners. ""We didn't see that there would be enough free cash flow, especially in the early years,"" a Monitor spokesman said.</br></br>The breakdown in talks increases the likelihood that EDS may have to write down assets associated with A.T. Kearney, said Cynthia L. Houlton, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, a unit of Royal Bank of Canada. EDS reported assets associated with Kearney of $276 million as of June 30.</br></br>""I don't think people are lining up to take the place of the Monitor Group,"" she said. Ms. Houlton doesn't own shares in EDS, and rates the stock ""sector perform."" RBC Capital Markets doesn't provide investment-banking services with EDS.</br></br>News of the deal collapse was reported on Crain's Chicago Business Web site."
"Texas' unemployment rate is hovering around 4%, so the state's fund for unemployment benefits ought to be flush with cash, right? Think again.</br></br>In the past year, the unemployment trust fund has seen a dramatic rise in the size of monthly benefit payments. Total payments in the first quarter of 1999 jumped 42% to about $312 million from $219 million in the same period last year.</br></br>At the same time, the monthly balance of the fund has decreased. As of last week, officials project the fund at the end of May will have a balance of about $847 million, 13% below the May 1998 balance.</br></br>Oddly, the trend is partly due to the state's healthy economy, which is in some ways aggravating the effect of Oil Patch and other layoffs that account for the shrinking fund balances. If current trends continue, the fund by this fall could drop so far that there will be little or no new money to transfer to the state's worker-training programs. It also could reach the level that would trigger an automatic increase in the unemployment insurance premiums paid by employers.</br></br>This outlook is, of course, subject to change; an unexpected drop in the number of people collecting jobless benefits would enable the fund to build back up. But the trend is unmistakable. In their latest projection, officials with the Texas Workforce Commission say the trust fund will have a balance of $651 million on Oct. 1, excluding money tentatively set aside for job training; as recently as March, officials projected a balance of $756 million."
"NEW YORK -- The dollar rose against most currencies yesterday, as the market's failure to push it below a key technical support against the mark triggered a wave of short-covering by bears who lost confidence in their positions.</br></br>Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.5880 marks, well above</br></br>1.5750 marks late Wednesday in New York. Sterling was trading at</br></br>$1.5355, down from $1.5425. Against the yen, however, the U.S. currency</br></br>was about unchanged, trading at 100.35 yen, compared with 100.30 yen"
"According to D.C.'s Department of Employment Services, 202,000 of the jobs in Washington were federal government positions as of November 2009. There were 471,000 private-sector positions.</br></br>At a time when unemployment in the District is at a record high, this intermingling can result in uniquely D.C. conversations: ""He was a level G-I-don't-even-know-what,"" but definitely something up there, says Alex MacLennan. MacLennan is at happy hour at a 14th Street NW bar, talking with a friend about the government worker he used to date. ""And he was on that schedule where he got every other Friday off.""</br></br>""And he was also at the gym at 9 a.m.,"" says MacLennan, instead of at his desk. Plus, the ex's boss let him leave early once or twice a week. The stereotype of the government worker used to fall within one of two categories. He could be the noble office drone, a human widget who bravely battled red tape. Or he could be the cobweb-covered sloth, overindulged compared with his private-sector counterparts, the ones who watch their unused vacation days float away like dreams deferred.</br></br>Either way, the most remarkable characteristic of the civil servant was being blandly unremarkable, which is why the Google phrase ""movies about federal employees"" will turn up exactly zero hits.</br></br>But during the dark days of the Great Recession, the sexiest fringe benefit to any job became security. Stodgy is hot. Civil servants = genius! Visits to federal jobs site USAJobs.gov were up 18 percent in 2009 from 2008, according to the Office of Personnel Management, and up 61 percent for those who came to the site more than once. In May 2009, a Gallup poll found that 40 percent of Americans would consider a federal career, compared with 24 percent in 2006. On Facebook groups for federal employees, there are sightings of fed groupies -- wall postings by people who are not employed by the government, but really wish they were."
"NEW YORK -- In a way, the U.S. could be entering another economic era. Recent changes in the American economy have significantly weakened the medicines that, for decades, policy makers have administered whenever it got sick. In the future, the government may be forced to let the economy recover from recessions a bit more on its own.</br></br>Ever since World War II, the federal government has employed fiscal and monetary policy to battle recessions. But in the current slump -- so far, at least -- it has been reluctant to resort to fiscal stimulus, by either stepping up spending or cutting taxes. The recession dates back to July 1990, but only now -- 17 months later -- is the government seriously considering entering the fray.</br></br>Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve, though much more active, has been singularly ineffective. With lenders shaky and overextended consumers and businesses hesitant to borrow, the Fed has little to show for two years of easing credit.</br></br>A widely noted result is the slippage in President Bush's re-election hopes. But what hasn't been widely noted is the possibility that the government's current paralysis may not be just a 1991 problem. It may linger on for years.</br></br>Anti-recession fiscal policy is becoming less practical. Already, the government's flexibility is severely limited by its debt, which now exceeds $3.5 trillion. And despite the 1990 budget accord, the debt is growing about $1 billion a day, day in and day out. Washington seems quite unwilling to curb the deficits, now or in the future."

"Sometimes provocative people become that way because they were provoked. Sharron Angle, 60, could be enjoying the 10 grandchildren she loves even more than her .44 magnum. Instead, she is the Republican nominee against Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's quest for a fifth term as senator. Her campaign began, in a sense, three decades ago, when a judge annoyed her.</br></br>When her son was depressed about having to repeat kindergarten -- ""He was a 6-year-old dropout"" -- she decided on home schooling, which Nevada law permitted. But a judge construed the law to require that parents who home-school must live at least 50 miles from a public school.</br></br>She and many kindred spirits descended on Carson City to get the Legislature to correct this. One legislator, irritated by such grass-roots impertinence, said, ""If I'd known there would be 500 people here instead of 50 and it would take five hours instead of 30 minutes, I would have thrown it [the legislation] in my drawer, and it would never have seen the light of day."" Angle asked a cowboy standing next to her, ""Can he do that?"" The cowboy said yep.

"The House Democratic leadership, fearing defeat by rebellious Democrats in league with Republicans, yesterday reluctantly embraced a plan to add $1 billion to this year‰Ûªs budget to help the crippled housing industry by subsidizing mortgage interest rates.</br></br>Since the Senate Banking Committee has also approved such a plan and the full Senate seems poised to follow suit, the House endorsement makes early congressional approval of some form of mortgage subsidy almost certain.</br></br>Yesterday‰Ûªs agreement by the leadership was reached after it appeared likely that the House would instead approve a bipartisan proposal to take $2 billion in synfuels funding to put into housing, despite the leadership‰Ûªs opposition, congressional sources said.</br></br>Faced with choosing between the devastated but politically powerful housing industry and the ably represented oil industry, the leadership followed a time-honored tradition: it chose both.

"Japan's stock and currency markets dealt the world's No. 2 economy a heavy blow Friday. The yen surged, battering shares of Japan's top exporters as the country nears recession.</br></br>In Tokyo, the yen reached a 13-year high against even the rising U.S. dollar. In late afternoon trading Friday in New York, the euro was at 119.05 yen, a six-year low and down sharply from 125.12 yen Thursday. The dollar was at 94.6 yen.</br></br>A strong yen wreaks havoc on Japan's export-driven economy, eroding the value of Japanese companies' overseas earnings, and often making the price of those products more expensive in overseas markets. After seeing sales to U.S. and Europe fall, exporters have been hit again as sales to the emerging markets have started to falter.</br></br>Some experts warn that the Nikkei 225 Stock Average, which dropped 9.6% Friday, will tumble even further next week if Japanese exporters disappoint investors with poor results and outlooks, as the rising currency may lead many to do.</br></br>For Japan, the rising yen and falling stock market come at a particularly delicate time. Gross domestic product shrank in the April-June quarter and most economists are expecting it to contract again in quarter that ended Sept. 30, which would qualify as a recession."
"How risky are investments in developing countries?</br></br>There is, of course, no easy answer. Political instability, limited track records, poor statistics -- they all make gauging risk a risky business.</br></br>But several companies try. What follows is a look at how two outfits evaluate the risk in some of the countries that are receiving the most attention from foreign investors.</br></br>The two risk-raters:</br></br>-- Economist Intelligence Unit, a New York-based subsidiary of The Economist Group, London. A rating of A, or 0-20 points, is the least risky. That's followed by B, 25-40 points; C, 45-55 points; D, 60-75 points; and E, 80-100 points. The ratings break down into three categories: medium-term lending risk, covering such factors as external debt and trends in the current account, with a maximum score of 45 points; political and policy risk, including factors such as the consistency of government policy and the quality of economic management, with a maximum score of 40 points; and short-term trade risk, including foreign-exchange reserves, with a cap of 15 points."

It is below last year‰Ûªs 7 per cent rate and the huge 12.2 per cent rate of 1074.</br></br>Unlike the overall consumer price index, the local increases are not adjusted for seasonal variation.</br></br>The unadjusted 1.8 per cent rise is slightly more than the 1.6 per cent rise nationwide. The government computes a Washington index every three months."
"David Gunn, 65 and a glutton for punishment, left retirement to run Amtrak. His office is in magnificently restored Union Station, a relic of something Gunn knows is gone forever -- the era of glamorous railroading. He explains his challenge by taking a visitor on a walk back to the 1930s.</br></br>He walks to the end of Union Station's passenger platform, looking north up the Washington-New York-Boston corridor. Almost everything that strikes the eye, Gunn says, from the transformers to the poles holding overhead electric power wires, was here in the 1930s, if not 1910. The foundations of more than 9,800 poles in the corridor are, Gunn says, ""in trouble.""</br></br>Deferred maintenance cannot forever be deferred for this railroad that two years ago mortgaged part of Penn Station in Manhattan to meet $300 million in expenses. Gunn's predecessor then said he was ""absolutely confident"" that Amtrak would reach ""operational self- sufficiency by the congressionally mandated deadline in 2003."" ""Fanciful"" is Gunn's dismissal of the idea that Amtrak can end its deficit. Fanciful, too, is the idea that the government will quit subsidizing Amtrak operations in the Northeast Corridor. Without subsidies, those operations would end for 1.1 million passengers a month, who would be put into the corridor's already congested highways and air space.</br></br>Furthermore, it is fanciful to think Congress will subsidize the Northeast Corridor without legislative logrolling to guarantee continuing subsidies of long-distance trains (routes of at least 500 miles) beyond the corridor, where five-sixths of Americans live. Trains such as the Sunset Limited, which is not crowded on its runs from Orlando to Los Angeles via New Orleans. Or the Texas Eagle, which, according to the Wall Street Journal, lost $38.4 million in 2001 ($1.70 for every $1 of revenue) on its 33-hour runs -- its meanderings, actually; it averages 39 mph -- between Chicago and San Antonio.</br></br>Amtrak accounts for only three-tenths of 1 percent of intercity travel. Do at least Amtrak's Northeast Corridor operations make money? There are two answers: Don't be daft. And: Yes, if you disregard sufficient expenses. The same is true of the 12 daily trains that carry 200,000 passengers a month -- up 25 percent over last year -- in the San Diego-Los Angeles-Santa Barbara corridor. But by performing valuable services in congested regions, these services may help force the government to quit pretending that self- sufficiency is just over the horizon and to decide what kind of intercity rail service it wants to pay for."
"WASHINGTON -- The current economic slowdown will make the federal budget deficit for fiscal 1991 at least $6 billion bigger than the administration anticipated, and perhaps as much as $15 billion bigger, White House Budget Director Richard Darman said.</br></br>The larger the administration's deficit projections are, the more difficult it will be for Congress to avoid triggering across-the-board federal spending cuts, known as a sequester, under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.</br></br>""We will eventually have bipartisan negotiations"" with Congress on budget-cutting, Mr. Darman told reporters outside a congressional hearing room yesterday. ""These are inescapable. If we don't, the sequester will be so large"" that Congress will find it unacceptable.</br></br>""The real question is whether the negotiations are going to take place in an orderly, constructive manner or whether they are going to be done in a context of crisis,"" he said.</br></br>Mr. Darman told the Joint Economic Committee that even if the economy bounces back and performs in 1990 precisely as the Bush administration expects, the weakness in the fourth quarter means the deficit will be $6.4 billion bigger than projections. The Bush budget assumed the economy would grow at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 1.5% in the fourth quarter; it grew only 0.9%, according to the latest Commerce Department estimates. Weaker growth reduces government tax receipts."
"Growing numbers of investing experts have been declaring that gold is a bubble: an insanely overvalued asset whose price is bound to burst.</br></br>There is no basis for that opinion. And understanding why can help point an investor toward clearer thinking about frenzied markets.</br></br>Sure, gold seems expensive. At its recent price of $1,813 an ounce, gold is off only slightly from the record high of $1,912 touched on Sept. 6 (unadjusted for inflation). Gold is up more than 40% over the past year, largely on fears that paper currencies like the dollar won't retain their value.</br></br>But that doesn't mean it is overvalued. Unlike bonds, which provide interest income, and stocks, which produce dividends and earnings growth, gold generates no cash flows. As John C. Bogle, founder of the Vanguard funds, told me two weeks ago, gold ""has no internal rate of return."" As a result, there isn't any reliable way to tell what it is worth.</br></br>So the people who say gold is in a bubble might well be right. But the people who think gold is heading for $2,500, $5,000 or $10,000 also might be right."
"After eight years of fitful changes in economic policy, credit crises anti mini-recessions, the dollar continues to decrease in value. Credit restraint and control of wages and prices have been tried intermittently but they were destined to fail.</br></br>Without the restraining support of a reduction in the federal deficit, the political burden is too great to maintain tight credit or stringent control of prices and wages long enough to get the job done.</br></br>Once again, the Federal Reserve is carrying the full burden of restraining a booming economy. Once again, interest rates are breaking new records and the mortgage market faces a reduction in the availability of funds.</br></br>The cause of high prices, including interest rates, is not a mean Federal Reserve System that wants to spoil everyone‰Ûªs fun. The Federal Reserve has not been parsimonious in supplying money and credit to the economy.</br></br>Instead, it has erred by supplying money and credit far in excess of the economy‰Ûªs capacity lo produce goods and services."
"Fund-raisers at Bowie State University spent extravagantly on banquets they weren't supposed to sponsor, cruises that few guests showed up for and dozens of other arguably wasteful items, according to an audit released yesterday.</br></br>In all, the Bowie State University Foundation ran up a $181,968 operating budget deficit in just two years, forcing it to borrow from endowment funds contributed to the university, state higher education officials were told yesterday.</br></br>The state university system's Board of Regents did not take action against any Bowie State officials yesterday, but Chairman Lance W. Billingsley said a subcommittee will decide whether anyone will be held responsible.</br></br>Three months in the making, the independent audit offered an explanation of the financial scandal that has cast a shadow over the 5,400-student historically black college in Prince George's County and already forced the dismissal of three chief fund-raisers.</br></br>The new audit also criticizes Bowie State President Nathanael Pollard Jr., saying he failed to check up on the foundation's finances."
"Prices of most debt securities were narrowly mixed in quiet trading as many of the biggest investors in the credit markets remained inactive, convinced that interest rates will climb further.</br></br>Prices of some long-term government bonds fell just under 1/4 point, or less than $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount, in dull trading. Shorter-term issues rose as some benchmark short-term interest rates eased. Prices of corporate, municipal and mortgage bonds also were little changed.</br></br>""Yes, I'm one of the gloomy ones,"" said Peter Hegel, who manages $6.5 billion of fixed-income funds as chief investment officer at Lisle, Ill.-based Van Kampen Merritt Inc. ""We've been fairly negative since the beginning of the summer,"" keeping the duration of the firm's bond portfolios shorter than most benchmark market indices, he said. A shorter duration reduces the risk of capital losses in a bear market.</br></br>""Unlike earlier in the expansion, we now have capacity constraints in the economy, and we're seeing the first rumblings of inflation,"" Mr. Hegel said. As a result, he predicted that the yield on the government's most recently issued 30-year bond could climb to 10% in the months ahead from just over 9.40%. ""I'll become bullish when I start to see signs that economy is slowing down,"" he added.</br></br>A few economists say that's already happening. David Bostian, head of Bostian Research Associates Inc., for instance, predicts long-term Treasury yields will be less than 8% by year's end because he says the economy has peaked."

But the tough-minded executive crowd proved to be just looking, thank you.</br></br>The tour, which has as its hosts Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.), and West Virginia Gov. Gaston Caperton, was unabashedly aimed at luring major business facilities away from the Washington area and into a state plagued by 7 percent unemployment.</br></br>During a daylong trip, which began at Union Station aboard a train provided by CSX Corp. and concluded at a restaurant in Shepherdstown, W.Va., the executives heard presentations on the economies of Jefferson, Morgan and Berkeley counties, visited the Bardane Industrial Park in Kearneysville and trooped through AT&T's material distribution center and Corning Glass Works' plant in Martinsburg.</br></br>West Virginia offers companies ""God's most beautiful land"" and ""America's most hard-working men and women,"" Rockefeller boasted, as well as low costs, affordable employee housing, manpower training programs and transportation links to the entire East Coast."
"A word of caution to baby boomers whose basic retirement plan is to inherit. Although the boomer generation, as a whole, will inherit an unprecedented amount of money, no single son or daughter can count on getting everything owned by mom and dad.</br></br>People 65 and up are holding some $5.2 trillion in wealth, says Robert Avery, professor of consumer economics at Cornell University. That number would be even higher if retirement plans were fully counted.</br></br>Thirty years ago, perhaps 15 percent of Americans were able to leave estates worth $50,000 or more in today's dollars. Now, it's 25 percent to 30 percent, Avery says. A much larger number will be bequeathing modest sums.</br></br>But there's many a slip twixt lip and cup. Your widowed dad might marry a younger woman and leave her the property. (And why not? It's his money.) Or he might live to age 99 in a nursing home, paring down your inheritance by $35,000 a year (you hate to count, but everyone does). Your ailing mom may favor a devoted nurse's aide, or grow financially close to her minister.</br></br>Economic and social trends also are working against inheritance. Your father might be nudged into early retirement, which will force him to use up his money faster. Your mother might take out a reverse mortgage, which pays her a monthly income out of the equity in her home."
"NEW YORK--U.S. oil futures declined Tuesday as traders were reluctant to place big bets while Federal Reserve officials debated the future of the central bank's key economic stimulus program.</br></br>Light, sweet crude for January delivery settled 26 cents, or 0.3%, lower at $97.22 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Nymex prices traded in a narrow range for most of the session as market participants chose to wait until Wednesday afternoon for potential clarity on the Fed's easy-money policies.</br></br>""It's a directionless trade,"" said John Kilduff, founding partner of Again Capital LLC, a New York hedge fund that focuses on energy, referring to the lack of significant price movement.</br></br>He added, ""You can make a strong argument on both sides, and there's a lot of room for the Fed to surprise us either way.""</br></br>Many traders expect the Fed to begin scaling back its so-called quantitative-easing program, in which it buys $85 billion each month in mortgage-backed securities and longer-term Treasury bonds, in the near future. The program has boosted oil prices by weakening the dollar, making crude cheaper to buy with other currencies."
"When Cuba spiraled into an economic crisis after the collapse of the Soviet Bloc in the early 1990s, an ambitious project to renovate Old Havana, the dilapidated core of this nation's cultural heritage, appeared to be moribund.</br></br>As the government realigned its priorities to salvage a political system that for decades had relied on billions of dollars in aid from its Communist allies, vital restoration of the old Spanish port settlement came to a virtual standstill. Clusters of brittle colonial-era edifices, such as cathedrals and monuments, continued to decay. Some collapsed, particularly during heavy tropical downpours.</br></br>Today, the revitalization of Old Havana is thriving as a largely self-sufficient enterprise that underscores Cuba's ability to attract badly needed hard currency, albeit not without feeling the sting of punitive measures imposed by the United States.</br></br>The success of the reconstruction plan stems from a series of recent economic and political reforms that, among other things, decentralized control of the project, giving the agency that oversees it, the city historian's office, greater independence from the state's inefficient bureaucracy and the ability to raise financing through free market means without having to rely on scarce government resources.</br></br>Administered by a special company established by the historian's office, the funds come mostly from profits earned by restaurants, cafes, hotels and other businesses in the historical quarter that have become part of Cuba's flourishing tourism industry."

"WASHINGTON -- Inflation news couldn't be much more soothing.</br></br>Wholesale prices unexpectedly fell 0.3% in January, after a 0.6% jump in December, the Labor Department said. Stripping out the volatile food and energy sectors, the producer price index was flat in January after inching up 0.1% the month before. ""Extremely well-behaved,"" said economist Marilyn Schaja of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, New York.</br></br>The scary monster of recent inflation reports -- energy prices -- has been tamed; those prices slipped 0.2% after three consecutive months of sharp acceleration. Given recent declines in crude oil and natural-gas prices, energy prices should come down further in coming months, analysts said. The food index dropped 1.0%, having risen sharply several months earlier when poor weather threatened many crops.</br></br>A few scattered red flags popped up, however. Prices of crude goods such as aluminum and copper shot up 5.2%, and even without food and energy jumped 2.0%. If those goods cost more money, often the products they're used to make will eventually cost more, too. ""Recall that in 1994, inflation showed up in the pipeline well ahead of the increases that eventually appeared"" in finished goods, warned economist Christopher Low of HSBC Markets Inc., New York. ""Don't get complacent.""</br></br>But Ms. Schaja of DLJ said analysis indicates a weak relationship between crude-goods prices and finished-goods prices, so very little of that increase should filter through. Also, industrial-material prices have already started coming back down this month, so the January increase likely will be reversed in coming months. Finally, Ms. Schaja noted that year-over-year core crude prices fell 3.7%. Meanwhile, prices of intermediate goods, or semifinished products like yarn and lumber, rose only 0.2%; the core index for intermediate goods was up just 0.1%."
"Caught between increasingly assertive Islamic militants and louder calls for democratic reforms, the balancing act performed by Gen. Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's president and a key U.S. ally, is becoming even trickier.</br></br>On Friday, Pakistan's Supreme Court reinstated the nation's top judge, ruling that his suspension by Gen. Musharraf was ""illegal"" and quashed a separate case of alleged misconduct by the chief justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry. Chief Justice Chaudhry's suspension last March -- the government said he used his position to help secure a police job for his son and took advantage of privileges such as using government aircraft -- sparked protests by lawyers and political opponents that has since blossomed into a powerful democratic movement. The government insisted the case had no political motive and that Gen. Musharraf had little choice under the constitution but to suspend Chief Justice Chaudhry. But opponents accused Gen. Musharraf of plotting to remove an independent-minded judge to forestall legal challenges to his plan to ask lawmakers for another term. The army general -- who took control of the country in a 1999 coup -- faces widespread demands within Pakistan to resign from the military if he wants to be re-elected as president again. So far, he has resisted taking off the uniform, as he would be constitutionally required to do by the end of this year and also allowing the return to Pakistan of his chief political opponents.</br></br>But today's victory for the nascent democratic movement is just one of many challenges to Gen. Musharraf, a leader President Bush has called Washington's strongest ally in the fight against al Qaeda. Just last week Pakistani commandos stormed the Red Mosque -- a center of radical-and-fundamentalist teaching in Islamabad -- after a monthlong siege. About 100 people died. Pakistani officials said the action was taken after Gen. Musharraf recognized the threat of the growing ""Talibanization"" of Pakistan and senior U.S. and Pakistani officials have said it was part of a broader effort to push back the Taliban and al Qaeda. But it also led tribal leaders to call off the tentative truce in Pakistan's lawless border area and in recent days, militants there -- and in Islamabad -- have killed hundreds of Pakistani troops and citizens.</br></br>The border area is a subject of intense interest for the U.S. as its intelligence community says that region has become a haven for al Qaeda's senior leadership -- including perhaps Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri. Al Qaeda leaders, according to U.S. officials, are using the border region to train recruits from Europe and Africa while reaching out globally to affiliate groups, particularly in Iraq and North Africa. But many counterterrorism officials wonder if Gen. Musharraf, who is also Pakistan's military chief, has the ability, will or political base to mount a major operation inside the tribal areas against al Qaeda and the Taliban, the Islamist fundamentalists who ruled Afghanistan until late 2001. Gen. Musharraf's troubles present some difficult choices for the Bush administration in its fight against Islamic extremism in the region. After the military's raid of the mosque, the U.S. government continued to offer statements of support. It recently pledged $750 million in aid over five years to help spur development in the tribal regions, the latest dollop in billions of dollars in military and economic assistance the U.S. has offered Pakistan since the Sept. 11 attacks.</br></br>---"
"WASHINGTON -- Weak payroll growth and declining unemployment suggest that the U.S. job market is growing at a slow but steady pace.</br></br>Employers added a disappointing 110,000 jobs in March, the fewest since July and a big decline from 243,000 in February, the Labor Department reported. Meanwhile, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 5.2% in March from 5.4% in February.</br></br>Economists believe that last month's lackluster performance in payroll growth is an indication of businesses turning more cautious in the face of profit pressures and another spike in energy prices.</br></br>Separately, the Commerce Department reported that construction spending increased 0.4% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.05 trillion. In addition, the Institute for Supply Management, which polls purchasing agents at more than 400 industrial companies, said its index of manufacturing activity was relatively unchanged at 55.2 in March. The new-orders index ticked higher to 57.1 from 55.8, while the employment gauge slipped to 53.3 from 57.4.</br></br>Index readings above 50 indicate the sector is expanding.

"My wife was watching C-Span on television a few weeks ago, and one of the chief economists at the Congressional Budget Office was talking about budget deficits. He said they were a major crisis, but people were being misled about their severity because most of the usual indicators -- such as prices of financial assets, inflation and real economic activity -- were giving off reasonably rosy, but false, signals.</br></br>My wife was skeptical. Couldn't it be that all of these indicators were right, and that the budget deficit was just not a big deal? Anyhow, where did this CBO economist get his information if not from all the data that gave different answers? Probably he was just a slave of some outmoded economic theory that predicted effects that hadn't shown up. Moreover, didn't David Ricardo have a theory that said that budget deficits were roughly equivalent to taxation, and didn't this theory conform pretty well with the evidence that this CBO fellow said we should ignore? I agreed with my wife and assured her that a growing number of economists were coming to that viewpoint, but that we still numbered only 22% of the membership of the American Economic Association.</br></br>I admit that federal budget deficits since 1984 have been higher than I would have predicted, based on a model that views deficits as a device to smooth out tax collections over time. For example, the budget deficit for the current fiscal year, when measured as the change in the privately held public debt, is about $210 billion. I would have predicted a deficit of between $110 billion and $170 billion: $60 billion associated with the federal net interest payments of $130 billion, $50 billion for the persistent failure to reach full employment, and as much as $60 billion to offset the surplus of the state and local sector. That leaves an excess deficit of $40 billion to $100 billion. Smaller but still significantly positive values apply for 1984 and 1985.</br></br>I see three possible explanations for the large budget deficits of recent years. First, they may simply be mistakes. In this case they are also good experiments, which economists can use to figure out the effects of budget deficits on the economy.</br></br>Second, people may believe that the ""Reagan Revolution"" portends a declining share of federal spending in gross national product. In that case current spending is temporarily high, and it makes sense to run a budget deficit rather than to enact a temporary increase in tax rates. But I find this forecast of declining federal spending doubtful, and there is no sign of it yet in the data."

"With U.S. consumer price inflation receding, the Federal Reserve has additional leeway to reduce interest rates further in the weeks ahead, though Fed officials currently don't see more rate cuts as a clear choice.</br></br>The U.S. consumer-price index was unchanged in September, the Labor Department said Thursday, after falling in August for the first time in almost two years. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so- called core consumer prices -- which are believed to give a more stable reading of inflation -- advanced just 0.1% last month. And the year-over-year rate of inflation, at 4.9%, is coming down from high levels reached this summer.</br></br>There was widespread softness in pricing. Transportation prices fell 0.6% as airline fares and new-car prices dropped. Housing, which accounts for 40% of the consumer-price index, fell 0.1% for a second straight month, the first back-to-back declines since 2001. Clothing prices fell 0.1% for the month.</br></br>Other signs of economic weakness are building, including a report by the Fed on Thursday that U.S. industrial production dropped sharply in September.</br></br>The inflation readings underscore a growing belief inside the Fed that inflation pressures are easing, as many senior officials expected earlier this year. Indeed, financial shocks like the one the U.S. is experiencing could eventually lead to the opposite of inflation -- deflation, or a broad decline in prices -- though that doesn't look like a serious risk, given the amount of stimulus going into the U.S. economy."

"Paris -- AFTER A GOOD RUN on European stocks, it may be time for investors to go Stateside.</br></br>Since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in mid-2004 -- and especially this year -- European stock markets have outperformed the U.S. by a wide margin. But with the Fed nearing the end of its policy of monetary restraint and the European Central Bank about to start raising rates, probably as early as today, it could be Wall Street's chance to shine.</br></br>Contending the ECB is as determined as the Fed to push interest rates to levels it thinks are right to damp inflation, Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin Securities, says this resolve ""could inhibit euro-zone equity-market performance just as Fed policy has hampered Wall Street."" European stocks, he adds, ""could be in for a period of underperformance, while the U.S. stock market makes up for some lost time.""</br></br>For the year to date, the Dow Jones Stoxx index of 600 leading European companies is up 19.3%. That compares with a measly 0.2% advance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a 3.1% increase in the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.</br></br>Behind the performance disparity is a Fed that in the past 17 months has steadily raised rates to 4% from 1%. Meanwhile, the ECB has left its key refinancing rate unchanged at 2% for 29 months and hasn't increased it in more than five years. In fact, since global stock markets bottomed on March 12, 2003, European equities -- on a total- return basis, which includes dividends reinvested -- have outperformed Wall Street by 56%, according to Morgan Stanley Capital International."

"At John D. Ashcroft's farewell ceremony yesterday at the Justice Department, acting Solicitor General Paul D. Clement rose to thank the outgoing attorney general ""for the steady stream of work he's provided"" to government lawyers.</br></br>He listed just a few cases: Ashcroft v.

His sensational announcement that the FBI had ""disrupted an unfolding terrorist plot to attack the United States by exploding a radioactive dirty bomb""? (Other officials quickly made it clear he dramatically overstated the threat.) His departing boast that ""the objective of securing the safety of Americans from crime and terror has been achieved""?

"The federal government posted its largest monthly budget deficit on record in Marcli with a $53.34 billion imbalance, the Treasury Department reported yesterday.</br></br>The March gap between spending and revenue pushed the deficit for the first six months of the fiscal year past the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction target for all of fiscal 1990.</br></br>Louis Crandall, an economist with R.H. Wrightson of New York, said the deficit so far this year points to a return to $200 billion imbalances that existed until recently.</br></br>Crandall attributed most of the March deficit to Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. payments, spending by the Resolution Trust Corp. to bail out failed savings and loans, expedited income tax refunds as a result of electronic filing systems and government losses because of the falling</br></br>The March figure boosted the deficit to $150.85 billion for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.

"The era of budget surpluses dawns, and the pilfering has already begun. Congress has just passed a huge transportation bill that busts the ceilings established by the balanced budget agreement just last year. And President Clinton, for his part, already has signed a bill containing a half-billion dollars of ""supplemental"" spending to pay for our Bosnia deployment.</br></br>This not only broke Clinton's own pledge to save every penny of the surplus for Social Security. By blatantly abusing the loophole for ""emergencies"" (the Bosnia deployment is already three years old and open-ended), it mocked the deficit reduction rule enshrined in the budget agreements of 1990, 1993 and 1997 that all new spending must be offset by cuts elsewhere.</br></br>We are now enjoying a glorious and unique economic moment. We have the lowest peacetime unemployment since 1957. There is no inflation. Clinton has just announced a $39 billion budget surplus for 1998. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that it might run as high as $63 billion. How do we keep from frittering away the current bounty?</br></br>Government cannot save its extra money by squirreling it away in a safe-deposit box. But it can do the equivalent by paying down the national debt, now a hefty $4 trillion. But how do you make politicians put away a surplus?</br></br>A little history. In 1968, in order to pay for the war in Vietnam and pretty up the numbers of a surging budget deficit, President Johnson arbitrarily decided to include Social Security in the budget. Social Security was then, as now, taking in more money every year from workers than it pays out to old folks. It helped LBJ produce balanced books."
"FRANCE TODAY has the highest unemployment rate among leading industrialized nations. The triumph of the leftist opposition in Sunday's election reflects voters‰Ûª understandable ahxiety about this state of affairs. Unfortunately, the winners‰Ûª program, if carried out, is likely to make the problem worse.</br></br>' Conservative French President Jacques Chirac gambled when he called early elections, hoping for a parliament that would support him during the remaining five years of his term. Instead, his conservative allies lost badly to the Socialist and Communist parties. Now Mr. Chirac will uncomfortably share power with a leftist government led by a Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin.</br></br>-As in any election, diverse factors of personality, tactics and policy played their parts. But the chief issue was one that confronts the United States and every other nation as well: how to balance the needs and desires of each country‰Ûªs population with the harsh rigors of economic globalization.</br></br>In today‰Ûªs world, technology and capital are increasingly mobile; businesses can set up shop wherever profits will be greatest. Not only can ! hey; businesses that pass up opportunities‰ÛÓout of loyalty to their home communities or countries, lor example, or by order of home governments‰ÛÓ may soon be passed by. Thus, nations find their own political possibilities limited; if they set taxes high to fund a generous social safety net, businesses will move away, shrinking the tax base and requiring even higher taxes.</br></br>France has one of the highest tax rates around; public spending accounts for more than of half its total economy, compared with about one-third in the United States. Government employs one-quarter of all workers, compared with one in seven in the United States. Nationalization of industry does guarantee that some jobs stay in France, and generous benefits‰ÛÓearly retirement ages, for example‰ÛÓare lovely for those with jobs. But both discourage private job creation; the unemployment rate in France is nearly 13 percent and growing."

"In mid-January, the National Association of Manufacturers issued a report warning that the Treasury Department‰Ûªs tax-simplification plan would harm capital formation and productivity, and could have a ""highly unfavorable‰Û effect on economic growth.</br></br>One week later at the regular NAM board of directors meeting, executives of such companies as General Motors and Procter & Gamble protested, saying they did not want their association criticizing a proposal that would lower tax rates for their firms. A flurry of letters from other members made the same point.</br></br>When NAM Chairman Stanley C. Pace of TRW met with Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III on Friday, he endorsed the concept of reform and lower rates, but expressed concern about some of the investment provisions. ‰ÛÏWe are not going to pick sides,‰Û said NAM Vice President Jerry Jasinowski.</br></br>As the NAM‰Ûªs experience shows, the lobbying battle lines on tax simplification are far from firm. More than three months after the Treasury Department made its proposal and less than two months before the final version is expected to go to Congress, many business interests don‰Ûªt know which side they are on.</br></br>""They don‰Ûªt know what their priorities are,‰Û said a staff member of the House Ways and Means Committee. ‰ÛÏIn 1981 [when Congress passed a major business tax cut], it was a monolith.‰Û"
"The economy is off to an unexpectedly fast start this year, and many economists now see the momentum being maintained through most of 1986. Only late this year or early next year do they see any signs of slowdown.</br></br>Bolstering their optimism are a spate of favorable statistical reports in recent weeks, the sharp slide in oil prices, the seeming pressure toward a cut in the federal budget deficit and a generally easy Federal Reserve credit policy, which many analysts expect to continue.</br></br>""First-quarter real GNP will be solid indeed -- a surprisingly strong 4.5% to 5.0%,"" says Donald H.

""Among other things,"" Mr. Hunt says, ""the drop in oil prices will keep the trade deficit from rising the way it did last year.""</br></br>Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter, polls four dozen leading economists each month on the outlook. Last month the analysts on the average expected 3.0% real growth this year. The latest report, released today, moved up the average to 3.1%.

Wallich yesterday rejected t he view held by the monetarist school that strict adherence by the Fed to pre-announced money supply targets ?would lead to stabler and ultimately jower interest rates.‰Û ' In a speech in Bethesda to the Robert Morris Associates, Wallich said that it 'may seem plausible that interest rates in the long run would be lower under such tight control of monetary aggregates ‰ÛÏthan a procedure that accepts temporary over- and under-shoots.‰Û</br></br>But in the short run, ‰ÛÏMonetary restraint, however steady, cannot quickly bringdown inflation nor interest rates,‰Û the Fed governor asserted. ‰ÛÏThe most plausible view is that the main impact of monetary restraint on prices occurs ivith a two-year lag.‰Û '‰Û¢ The Federal Reserve has been widely criticized this year for permitting exceedingly wide fluctuations in both interest rates and in the monetary aggregates.

"The first thing is to keep wishing really hard that the energized U.S. economy keeps on going and going and going.</br></br>Baltimore, for example, began a long downward slide in 1990 that was accelerated by a devastating recession that infected its manufacturing, real estate and financial services industries.</br></br>But now, the nation's recovery has gone on long enough that its benefits have spread even to hard-hit urban cores like Baltimore's, or the District's.</br></br>Employment in Baltimore peaked at 470,900 in March of 1980. Eight years later, it had plunged to around 395,000, or a net loss of more than 75,000 jobs, based on monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics reports. The job shrinkage continued even after the U.S. and Maryland economies turned upward as the city's rising crime and drug problems and deteriorating schools chased families and employers away.</br></br>But in the past year, Baltimore has enjoyed a small renaissance. Employment in the last three months of 1999 averaged around 417,000-- a gain of more than 4 percent from the previous year's low point."
"The unemployment rate has exceeded 8% for more than three years. This has lead some commentators and policy makers to speculate that there has been a fundamental change in the labor market. The view is that today's economy cannot support unemployment rates below 5%--like the levels that prevailed before the recession and in the late 1990s. Those in government may take some comfort in this view. It lowers expectations and provides a rationale for the dismal labor market.</br></br>Excuses aside, this issue is also important for central banks. The Federal Reserve and other central banks have some policy choices to make if the high rates of unemployment reflect cyclic phenomena. But if the problem is structural--perhaps reflecting a mismatch between skills needed by business and skills possessed by the unemployed--there is little the Fed can do.</br></br>Research I've done with James Spletzer of the U.S. Census Bureau shows that the problems in the labor market are not structural. They reflect slow economic growth, and the cure is a decent recovery.</br></br>In 2007, the unemployment rate was 4.4%. Two years later, it reached 10%. The structure of a modern economy does not change that quickly. The demographic composition of the labor force, its educational breakdown and even the industrial mix did not differ much between 2007 and 2009.</br></br>More specifically, from 2007 to 2009 unemployment grew dramatically in a few industries, and these changes contributed to the rise in overall unemployment. But the changes were similar to those experienced in prior recessions. As unemployment rates declined somewhat after 2009, the pattern played out in reverse. Industries that saw the largest increases in unemployment were the ones with the largest decreases as overall unemployment fell."

Still, the report's details may offer encouragement."
"he stock market was right on the money in predicting a quick victory in the war. The question now is whether Wall Street's confidence in the economy will prove to be equally accurate.</br></br>This year's powerful stock market rally, which took off in mid-January when the first bombs fell on Baghdad, has acquired so much internal momentum that many analysts now predict that stock prices will remain on an overall upward trajectory through the spring and into early summer.</br></br>""Without much problem, over the next two to four months, I think we can get to a level of 3200 on the Dow,"" said Thomas F.

It was initially believed that earnings would be up 5 percent to 10 percent, but they have been running a hefty 15 percent to 20 percent. Oddly enough, the stock market has not responded that positively to these upbeat earnings due to inflation fears and rising interest rates.</br></br>It also is interesting to note that the quality credit ratings on corporate fixed-income securities have continued to decline in the face of the good earnings. Moody‰Ûªs Investment Service just released their corporate review for the quarter, and it highlights these seemingly paradoxical events.</br></br>Of the 109 companies that incurred rating changes, 75 (69 percent) were downgraded and 34 (31 percent) were upgraded. A year ago, downgrades were 64 percent of the total.</br></br>The 75 companies that were downgraded had $137 billion in debt issues that were affected, compared to only $14 billion of debt securities of the 34 companies that were upgraded. The bulk of these came from two areas: automotive and banking.</br></br>A whopping $52 billion was represented by the downgrading of General Motors Corp. and its financing arm. General Motors Acceptance Corp. Another $40 billion of downgrades occurred with the lowering of the credit ratings by Moody‰Ûªs on eight money center banks.

"WASHINGTON -- Business groups are promising to wage a court battle over government regulations that would allow states to use unemployment-insurance money to give new parents paid time off from their jobs.</br></br>The regulations, expected to be formally introduced today, would allow state governments to use unemployment-insurance funds to pay parents of newborn or adopted children while they are on leave from their jobs. A lawsuit challenging the rules is expected by the end of the week.</br></br>The guidelines would amend 1993's Family and Medical Leave Act, which allows parents to take as much as 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for new children or sick relatives. White House officials say many Americans are simply unable to take such leave if it means doing without a regular paycheck. With jobs plentiful in a surging economy, the officials argue that excess unemployment-insurance funds can safely be shifted to pay for leaves.</br></br>""In today's strong economy, we can provide this important benefit without threatening the fiscal strength of the unemployment-insurance programs,"" said Labor Secretary Alexis Herman.</br></br>Nonsense, say many business groups, who accuse the White House of playing politics with money meant to provide a safety net for out-of-work Americans.

Kennedy, Union Carbide chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement that the personnel cuts and other steps announced are aimed at boosting annual pretax earnings by $250 million by 1994. A Carbide spokesman said some of the staff cuts have already taken place and others will continue until year end 1994.</br></br>Mr. Kennedy said salaries of senior officers would be temporarily frozen. The variable compensation of mid-level and senior managers will be ""sharply reduced,"" compared with recent years, to reflect lower profits as well, Mr. Kennedy said.</br></br>At the end of last year Union Carbide had 37,756 employees world-wide.</br></br>The announcement, made shortly before the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, helped boost the company's stock price; it was quoted at $22.375, up 50 cents, in late trading."
"When Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld sought to draw a distinction recently between the ""Old Europe"" represented by France and Germany and the ""New Europe"" of the fledgling democracies in the east, he stirred up a hornet's nest of criticism among Europeans who believed he was trying to divide the continent into skeptics and supporters of American policy toward Iraq and the Middle East.</br></br>Rumsfeld's observation was the right answer, but to the wrong question. There is no simple dichotomy in Europe as to who supports military action against Baghdad. Just as in the United States, you can find liberals in every corner of Europe who want to see Saddam Hussein overthrown, by force if necessary, and conservatives who think a U.S.-led military campaign would be disastrous for Western interests.</br></br>Where Rumsfeld's comments struck closer to the mark was in the implied notion that Europe's center of gravity is shifting east. In the postmodern European order, where war is now largely unthinkable, power is no longer measured by military arsenals but by economic vigor. Next year, when the European Union embraces 10 new members, the 25-nation group will include 450 million relatively prosperous citizens and account for more than one-fifth of global economic activity. But as the EU expands toward Russia's doorstep and consolidates its economic power, the locus of Europe's future economic dynamism will lie with the former communist societies of Central and Eastern Europe.</br></br>Over the next decade, Europe's fastest growth rate and biggest income surge are projected to occur in the eastern swath, stretching from the Baltic states to Bulgaria. American and European companies are beginning to pour investments into the region, seeking to capitalize on the desires of youthful populations eager to raise their living standards to match those in the West and to take advantage of labor costs that are one-fifth those in Germany. Jeffrey Immelt, chief executive officer of General Electric, says the new eastern states entering the EU will be a key corporate target over the next five years and could prove, in the short term, to be a more lucrative market than China.</br></br>The attraction of ""New Europe"" is not hard to understand. Deprived of material comforts during four decades of communism, tens of millions of Central and Eastern Europeans are determined to make up for lost time by acquiring the emblems of prosperity -- fast cars, stylish furniture, chic clothes and second homes -- that their cousins in the West have long taken for granted. The consumer frenzy gathering momentum in the east has not been witnessed on the continent since the go-go '50s, when Germany's postwar economic miracle bolstered the rest of Western Europe."
"The nation's economic recovery has lasted longer than a typical expansion, and America's corporate leaders see nothing to stop it from continuing through next year.</br></br>To the leaders of Fortune 500 companies, who wrapped up three days of discussion today, the Federal Reserve under Chairman Alan Greenspan has achieved a rare feat. It has brought the economy in for a soft landing -- in which growth is slowed enough to keep inflation under control without dumping the country into a recession. This means the four-year-old economic recovery can keep cruising along.</br></br>The Business Council also said the long-term outlook for the economy could be improved even further if Congress cuts federal spending but avoids the temptation to put the reductions into tax cuts that could add to the federal deficit.</br></br>The executives seemed confident as they listed the evidence that suggests continued good times are ahead.</br></br>""A large majority of members thought monetary policy over the past year has been just about right,"" said Richard Rosenberg, who runs BankAmerica Corp."
"The outlook for a strong spring grew dimmer for the nation's big retailers today as they reported generally disappointing results for February.</br></br>While many value-oriented retailers and some clothing stores, such as Talbots, did well, other merchants, most notably department stores and apparel retailers, including Gap, languished amid slowing consumer spending.</br></br>Analysts said it was clear that consumers, who have been spending cautiously since last June, continue to retrench.</br></br>""This is the new reality that we are going to most likely see going forward,"" said Michael P. Niemera, vice president of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. He added that this was the most store chains he has seen reporting declines since July 1996.</br></br>February is not a major contributor to retailers' profits, but it does reflect consumer psychology. Stock market volatility and high energy prices continue to plague Americans, and their confidence as measured by the Conference Board fell in February to its lowest level in more than four years."
"Stocks struggled to a mixed finish after the Federal Reserve's widely expected interest-rate increase did little to calm turbulent U.S. financial markets.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.85 to close at 11,003.20.

"The U.S. economy continued to grow rapidly last month, but the growth is not adding much to inflation, according to two government reports released yesterday.</br></br>Retail sales rose 1.2 percent last month - about twice what many analysts had expected - as consumers stepped up their purchases of new cars, light trucks, furniture and building supplies, the Commerce Department said.</br></br>On the strength of November's sales report, and upward revisions for September and October that were announced yesterday, forecasters said the growth rate for the three months from October through December should hit 4 percent or more despite the Federal Reserve's efforts to slow that pace by raising short-term interest rates. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and other central bank officials have said that if growth does not slow, the economy will overheat and cause inflation to accelerate.</br></br>But the other report out yesterday - on the prices producers charge when they first sell completed goods - showed few signs of added inflation.</br></br>The Labor Department said the producer price index rose 0.5 percent last month largely because of a large upswing in gasoline and some other energy prices.

"NEW YORK‰ÛÓIf there‰Ûªs one thing the average investor and the managers of big money agree on these days, it is that the stock market is a tricky and potentially dangerous place to play.1</br></br>For the investor, the answer is simple‰ÛÓstay away.

"QWe signed a contract to purchase our first home last week, and settlement is scheduled for mid-May. Before the contract was signed, we shopped around for the best mortgage. After the real estate contract was signed, we immediately contacted the lender we had selected and made a formal application. The lender asked us if we want to lock in the interest rate.</br></br>This is our first house, and we have absolutely no understanding of the way the mortgage market works, so we did not understand his question. However, he explained that if we lock in by signing a document called a ""loan lock-in,"" the rate the lender quoted would be guaranteed as long as settlement takes place by the time specified in the sales contract. We know that interest rates are on the rise. Will this lock-in document protect us?</br></br>AA lock-in agreement will be your best protection, but all terms and conditions must be spelled out clearly and the document must be in writing.</br></br>In the past few years, mortgage interest rates have been at their all-time low. So potential borrowers were satisfied with their under- 6 percent rates. But now that rates are on the rise, potential home buyers want absolute certainty that the loan they have arranged will in fact be available on the day of closing. I believe that we have seen the last of the under-6 percent loan rates, at least for the foreseeable future. Thus, the concept of locking in your mortgage interest rate becomes important.</br></br>You are concerned that your lender will honor its commitment to you. This is understandable. Even if you can afford a higher-rate loan, you may now have a double problem: I strongly suspect that because property values have dramatically escalated in the past few years, you probably agreed to pay a high price for your house and a higher mortgage rate will mean an even larger monthly payment."

Incidentally, the market has declined about 7 to 10 per cent (depending on which stock price average you look at) from the all-time peak which was registered about seven weeks ago.</br></br>This seems to be one of those times when the ‰ÛÏincidental‰Û is attracting much more attention than the long-term perspective. Stock price declines of as much as 10 per i cent are not especially unusual, and when the setbacks are limited to that proportion there usually is no adverse psychological effect upon the individuals or the businessman‰Ûªs propensity to spend.</br></br>But each time a stock market decline approaches 10 per cent within a brief period, there tends to be a mounting concern about the possibility that the current weakness might be the move that will develop into something more serious. And that seems to describe the state of mind of business analysts and investment managers at this juncture.</br></br>Last week I had occasion to visit with numerous investment managers in traditionally conservative Boston and I found a considerably greater degree of skepticism about common stock investments in that quarter than seems to be present in either - New York or Washington."

The CBC hopes the funding will provide for about 300,000 jobs.</br></br>The failure to secure the money illustrates a broader challenge for the CBC. In the midst of the recession, black lawmakers and civil rights advocates have called for specific policies to aid African Americans and other low-income people. Their argument is twofold: At 16 percent, the unemployment rate among blacks is higher than for other groups, and the increase in federal spending to ease the recession could help address persistent unemployment and other long-standing problems for blacks and low-income people.</br></br>Rather than focus their efforts on President Obama, who has expressed reluctance to target funds for blacks or any other group, the CBC has tried to push measures through Congress.

"General Motors Corp. is suffering through its worst strike in nearly three decades because it says it must win increased productivity from its workers. A new report released here today provided fresh ammunition for the company's case by showing just how far the nation's biggest automaker trails its North American rivals.</br></br>GM loses an average of $104 per vehicle on every car and truck it produces in North America, compared with an average of $1,520 earned by Ford Motor Co. and $1,336 earned by Chrysler Corp., according to an annual report published by Harbour and Associates Inc., an independent management consulting and automotive research firm in Troy, Mich.</br></br>Looked at another way, GM would have to cut its annual labor and benefit costs by an average of $4,439 per vehicle to match North America's most efficient producer, Nissan Motor Co. in Smyrna, Tenn. GM also would have to eliminate 54,915 workers from its production payrolls, according to the Harbour report.</br></br>The Harbour report is anxiously awaited every year by auto industry executives who want to see how their companies stack up against rivals in the crucial North American market. GM officials made little effort to sugarcoat the news about their bad report card, acknowledging that it shows the company needs to improve its performance.</br></br>Ford executives were ecstatic with the report, handing out laudatory press releases at today's news conference.

"If Japan is worried by the sudden outbreak of protectionist bombast in Washington, welcome to the club. We too have been more than a little shaken by the King Kong roars from the House and Senate chambers this past week. They threaten to touch off jungle emotions no one could control. And nothing would halt the U.S. economic recovery or send U.S. living standards tumbling faster than a trade war with Japan.</br></br>The most serious warning signal came Tuesday when a resolution was whooped through Sen. Packwood's Finance Committee demanding U.S. retaliation with tariffs and quotas unless the Japanese compensate Americans for sales lost because of ""unfair trade practices."" Sen. Dole wisely pigeonholed this document to give legislators a chance to cool off on their Easter holidays, but there is no guarantee they will return with any greater wisdom than when they left.</br></br>As we have said here before, Japan is not blameless for this outburst of jingoism. Prime Minister Nakasone should have been more forthcoming when the U.S. asked for a fairer shot at the Japanese market for telecommunications equipment. The Japanese finally made concessions but Mr. Nakasone still is insisting that a Japanese committee should ""approve"" imported equipment, at least for the next year. That has a protectionist smell.</br></br>It's inconceivable why Japan plays games like this. With its huge stake in international trade, it should strive to make itself one of the world's least protectionist nations. Its tariffs are lower than those of the U.S., but its non-tariff barriers are the rub. Mr. Nakasone has promised new ""market opening"" measures this month, but it will come as a big surprise if they are impressive improvements.</br></br>The U.S. would be even more foolish, however, if it took steps to limit its trade with Japan. As George Gilder observed so astutely on this page last week, U.S.-Japanese trade is synergistic. Both sides benefit enormously, despite the U.S. ""deficit"" American mercantilists are always harping about. High-quality Japanese components are vital to high-tech U.S. products. Japanese competition keeps U.S. manufacturers on their toes. Most important, inexpensive Japanese goods help Americans raise their living standards, reducing wage demands on U.S. manufacturers."
"NEW YORK -- The hairy beast of inflation, hunted to the brink of extinction in the broader economy, has taken refuge in the Ivory Tower.</br></br>Even while prices on everything from clothing to computer chips steadily decline, the cost of getting an education continues to rise, whether the sought-after institution is a private Ivy League college, a public university or a popular preschool.</br></br>In recent weeks, private universities have been announcing tuition for the 1999-2000 academic year, and the increases -- which range between 3% and 5% -- are more than double the annual rate of inflation. Private grade schools and preschools are boosting tuition as much as 7%. Public universities, which depend on state legislation to determine tuition, won't release new fees until the summer. However, previous increases have tended to be slightly lower than private-school increases, but still above inflation.</br></br>To hear some schools tell it, students should be happy that the increases aren't higher. ""The actual cost of a Harvard education is close to $48,000 per year,"" lamented Harvard University when it announced a few weeks ago that next fall's fees will rise 3.3% to $32,164. Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., which plans to charge $30,939 for tuition and room and board next fall, seems disappointed that its tuition remains ""significantly behind our major competition-Harvard, Yale and Princeton. The 3.5% [increase] will not close the gap.""</br></br>How can educational institutions justify raising tuition at a time when inflation has nearly disappeared and when the stock market's stunning performance has boosted college endowments about 74%, on average, in the past four years?"

"Through two arduous days of economy-energy discussions at President Ford‰Ûªs ski chalet in Vail, Colo., it became obvious that Secretary of the Treasury William Simon had lost his long fight for a restrictive, anti-iniia-tionary budget in the face of recession.</br></br>Although no decision was announced byjMr. Ford, even Simon‰Ûªs lieutenants cohcede he is the loser of a year-long strugle with lame-duck Budget Director Roy Ash. The President will support not only income tax cuts but high federal spending to stimulate business. Injuring a colossal budget deficit that could surpass $40 billion.</br></br>Both to recoup part of that loss and to conserve energy, Mr. Ford last weekend definitely approved a new excise tax on oil imports. That is part of an overall energy package, approved at Vail, to reduce consumption and increase production while abandoning the old Nixon-Ford concept of solving the energy crisis by voluntary action.</br></br>13his, dressed in ski sweaters in the luxurious winter resort, the President and his top officials on Dec. 27 and 28 buried economy-energy policies of Mr. Ford‰Ûªs first five months and their Nixon roots. In incongruous surroundings, Mr. Ford belatedly changed economic direction at a time when public confidence was falling quickly.</br></br>The most basic debate came Saturday morning, beginning the second day of meetings. Simon made his last pitch for budget restraint. While advocating anti-recessionary tax cuts, the Secretary of the Treasury warned that federal spending must be checked to prevent perpetual inflation. Indeed, Simon has hoped tax cuts would permit reducing both federal spending and the government itself."
"Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>TOKYO -- In a surprise knock to Japan's economic recovery, growth decelerated during the April-to-June period amid a sharp slowdown in corporate capital spending.</br></br>Gross domestic product grew 0.4% in real, or price-adjusted, terms from the previous quarter, or 1.7% on an annualized basis, marking the fifth straight quarter of economic expansion.</br></br>That was much worse than the average forecast of economists surveyed by and Nikkei News of a 1% rise from the previous quarter and 4.2% annualized expansion, and also was below the 3% rise marked by the U.S. in the same period. Japan's second-quarter growth compares with revised 7.4% annualized expansion during the October-to-December period and a 6.6% rise during the January-to-March period.</br></br>However, economists said the disappointing figures didn't suggest the economy has entered a longer-term slowdown."
"VINEYARD, Utah -- The United Steelworkers union will vote today on a proposed new 18-month contract reached with Geneva Steel. The new pact offers wage increases and adds bonuses for productivity, while keeping the other terms of the four-year agreement it replaces.</br></br>If the plan is ratified, the 2,100 workers would receive an immediate across-the-board wage increase of 25 cents an hour and an additional 15-cents-an-hour boost on the anniversary date of the contract. Compensation under the plan for attaining an annual production rate of 1.5 million tons will be guaranteed, thus assuring employees a 33-cents-an-hour payment in addition to the across-the-board increases.</br></br>Additional compensation under the plan will be based upon increased plantwide production levels: If it ships at a 1.6 million-ton annual rate, workers will receive 48 cents an hour, while they would earn an extra $1.84 an hour if the plant hits the company's goal of 2.5 millions tons. The present hourly wage for a middle-level worker is $13.15 an hour.</br></br>In 1992, the company shipped at a 1.4 million-ton annual rate, but this year has improved to a rate of 1.6 million to 1.7 million tons, based on the first seven months of the year, a Geneva spokesman said.</br></br>The short duration of the contract will give workers and management enough time to evaluate the pay-for-performance system, the company said."
"The basis for an optimistic outlook on business in 1956 is the powerful procedures developed to keep the economy from spiraling inflation or deflation. This reason was expressed yesterday by Arthur R. Upgren, dean of the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration, Dartmouth College in addressing the eighth regional conference of the American Savings & Loan Institute at the Sheraton-Park Hotel.</br></br>Dr. Upgren referred to the record of housing expenditures to emphasize the strength of the economy. He recalled that President Eisenhower said about a year ago that the gross ^national prodiction in 1956 might reach $500 billion, an estimate of the Joint Committee on the Economic Report. The output for 1965 was calculated at $535 billion.</br></br>When the estimates werei made housing expenditures! were at the annual rate of $11.8. billion. The housing estimate j ifor 1956 was $16 billion. In the) second quarter of 1955, total j housing expenditures were at [the annual rate of $16.3 billion,1 so that the actual rate of outlay in one year surpassed an [estimate made for 11 years ahead.</br></br>William J.

"MUTUAL-FUND INVESTORS may profit by procrastinating in coming weeks.</br></br>Investors thinking about buying mutual-fund shares soon should be careful not to fall into a painful year-end tax trap. Stock-market mutual funds typically distribute income and capital gains to shareholders around the end of each year, usually December. If you invest in a fund shortly before such a payout, you generally will owe 1995 taxes on the entire distribution, unless, of course, you bought the shares for a tax-deferred retirement account.</br></br>This year, many stock-market funds are likely to make unusually big payouts because of booming stock prices. Thus, investors need to be especially careful to check with funds about year-end distribution plans before buying, warns Stephen W. DeFilippis of West Suburban Income Tax Service in Glen Ellyn, Ill. Ask how much -- and when -- a fund expects to pay.</br></br>Then consider waiting to buy until just after the record date, he says.</br></br>THE SUPREME COURT declines to hear a municipal-bond case."
"Maria Foscarinis has White House as a backdrop as she accuses cities of trying to hide the homeless from public view.</br></br>As the recession creates a swelling tide of people out of work and on the streets, some city governments across the country are passing laws that show a new hostility toward the homeless, a leading advocacy group said yesterday.</br></br>From Miami and Atlanta, which are pushing ‰ÛÏ'hospitality zones‰Û where the homeless would be banned, to the District, where stiff anti-panhandling legislation is pending before the D.C. Council, cities are taking steps that make it even harder to survive on the streets, according to a new study by the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty.</br></br>‰ÛÏInstead of working to eliminate homelessness, some governments are trying to eliminate the homeless,‰Û said Maria Foscarinis, director of the center.</br></br>Foscarinis said the new laws are aimed at sweeping the homeless from view‰ÛÓfrom public places such as subway stations and parks, where they often sleep, and from the streets where many beg for money or food. But, she said, little is being done to address the problems that put people on the street to begin with: a lack of jobs and affordable housing."
"The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) will estimate this week that the federal budget deficit for fiscal 1991 will be $138 billion, congressional sources said.</br></br>The figure is substantially higher than the roughly $100 billion deficit projected by the Bush administration, the sources said. Both estimates are far higher than the $64 billion deficit target for fiscal 1991 set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget law. That law requires that enough spending cuts and revenue-raising measures be taken to achieve a $64 billion deficit in fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1.</br></br>The CBO estimates provide fresh evidence that the nonpartisan congressional agency is far less optimistic about the budget outlook than is the president's Office of Management and Budget. The estimates are based on projections that assume current spending and tax policies do not change.</br></br>While the CBO figures are sure to be cited by administration critics who think that the OMB projections are too rosy, their practical impact on the budget process is limited.</br></br>The congressional agency plays only an advisory role in determining whether the deficit targets set by Gramm-Rudman-Hollings have been breached. By law, it is the OMB estimates that are used at the beginning of each fiscal year to determine whether spending must be cut across the board to meet the law's requirements."
"LONDON, Aug. 28 (UPI)‰ÛÓ The U.S. dollar moved fractionally higher in world money markets today, partly reflecting higher interest rates in the United States and Japan but mostly continuing the dollar‰Ûªs general upward trend.</br></br>Dealers and traders tended to discount specific causes for the reversal of Monday‰Ûªs slight dollar slide.</br></br>‰ÛÏThe fluctuations in August have little to do with the underlying trend, which is a gradual improvement of the dollar,‰Û said a Paris banker in a typical comment.</br></br>But the higher American and Japanese interest rates helped price the dollar upward in every market. The price of gold also rose slightly.</br></br>The dollar closed higher on both branches of the Paris market‰ÛÓat 4.40 francs for the financial dollar tourists use and at 4.35 francs for the official commercial dollar."
"The purchasing power of welfare benefits for low-income families with children has dropped 33 percent over the past 14 years because states did not raise benefits to keep pace with inflation, according to a report by the House Ways and Means Committee.</br></br>Using Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) statistics compiled by the Congressional Research Service, the committee said that in nominal dollars, the average monthly maximum benefit paid by states for a family of four with no other income rose from $225 to $366 between 1970 and the start of 1984.</br></br>AFDC benefit payable in the District of Columbia for a family of four declined 41 percent in purchasing power from 1970 to 1984. In Maryland the decline due to inflation was 31 percent and in Virginia 47 percent.</br></br>Under AFDC, the states set their own benefits levels and the federal goveniment reimburses them for a share of the cost, ranging from 50 to 78 percent. Poorer states get the higher share.</br></br>The Census Bureau recently cited the failure of the states to keep welfare payments in step with inflation as a major reason that the percentage of Americans in poverty had risen by about one-third from 1979 to 1982."
"Secretary of Labor Willard Wirtz told Congress yesterday that the Nation‰Ûªs annual loss from unemployment is equivalent to ‰ÛÏshutting the country down‰ÛÓwith no production, no services, no pay ‰ÛÓ for over three weeks.‰Û</br></br>Secretary of Labor Willard Wirtz told Congress yesterday that the Nation‰Ûªs annual loss from unemployment is equivalent to ‰ÛÏshutting the country down‰ÛÓwith no production, no services, no pay ‰ÛÓ for over three weeks.‰Û ‰ÛÏIf that actually happened, we wuld do something about it,‰Û Wirtz said. But as it is, he continued the loss of work time is so scattered throughout the economy that the impact is not seen so dramatically.</br></br>Calling unemployment the Nations ‰ÛÏmost serious domestic problem,‰Û Wirtz said monthly unemployment figures are misleading. The jobless total for April was around 4 million, or slightly over 5% per cent of the Nation‰Ûªs work force. But Wirtz said reliable estimates indicate that approximately 14 million men and women were unemployed at some time during the year 1962.</br></br>He said unemployment and underemployment cost the Nation between $30 billion and $40 billion in goods and services last year alone.</br></br>Wirtz was the lead-off witness as the Senate Manpower and Employment Subcommittee began what its chairman, Sen. Joseph S. Clark (D-Pa.), called the country's first intensive study of the entire U. S. manpower problem."
"Despite a falling unemployment rate, labor costs in the United States continue to rise at a moderate annual rate of 3.4 percent, the Labor Department reported yesterday.</br></br>The department's employment cost index, which covers wages, salaries and fringe benefits, increased 1.2 percent in the third quarter and 3.4 percent in the 12 months ended in September, the department said.</br></br>Many forecasters and financial market participants, concerned about a possible acceleration of inflation, have been watching various measures of wages to spot any indication that labor costs have begun to increase more rapidly. Unless productivity-output per hour worked-also rose, a faster rate of wage change likely would mean higher inflation. Some expected that lower unemployment would raise employment costs by increasing competition to hire workers.</br></br>However, the quarterly increase in the index was almost identical to a 1.1 percent rise in the third quarter of last year. The index rose 0.7 percent in the second quarter, but because the figures are not adjusted for seasonal variation, comparing changes from one quarter to the next may be misleading.</br></br>For the 12 months ended in June, the increase was 3.3 percent, slightly less than the 3.4 percent in the year ended in September. For the year ended in September 1986, the rise was 3.6 percent."
"Robert Benmosche, chief executive of American International Group Inc., has seen his tenure marked by multiple challenges, the latest being his cancer diagnosis.</br></br>The disease was discovered last month following a routine medical check-up. The news came as the government-controlled insurer had a spate of positive developments to report, including the sale of one foreign insurance unit, the successful public offering of another, and the announcement of a plan to move on from government ownership and repay taxpayers.</br></br>Mr. Benmosche, who took the helm of the company in August 2009, recently sat for an interview on the 18th floor of AIG's New York headquarters. He talked about what AIG needs to accomplish before the year's end to prepare for the government's exit, the head winds facing its insurance businesses, and how he intends to deal with his illness, key details of which he hasn't divulged to AIG board members and government officials. Excerpts follow.</br></br>WSJ: AIG recently mapped out an exit-strategy plan to show investors and customers how the company intends to repay the government. Why do this and what has been the effect so far?</br></br>Mr. Benmosche: If you're a customer, you want to know whether this company is going to make it or not. Many people were saying we're a ward of the state, that there's no way we could pay back the taxpayers. But if you do an analysis, this is at least a $70 billion company and we will have about 1.8 billion shares. Our recent quarterly earnings [for core insurance operations] show we can earn $8 billion to $9 billion pretax income annually if other charges and write-downs stop occurring."

An excerpt from the Post of Oct. 20, 1987:</br></br>The stock market was devastated by the worst one-day collapse in history yesterday in a pandemonium of panic selling that shattered all records and swamped stock exchanges around the country and overseas.</br></br>The best-known market barometer -- the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks -- plummeted 508 points, five times the previous record set last Friday. The Dow closed at 1738, dropping 22.6 percent, or nearly double the 12.8 percent plunge of Oct. 28, 1929, the crash that began the Great Depression.</br></br>More than 604 million shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange and 239 million on the American and over-the-counter markets, shattering previous records."

"Author: Min Zeng</br></br>NEW YORK--Longer-dated Treasurys rose as the bond market showed some tentative signs of recovery after the biggest two-day selloff in two years.</br></br>The key boost came from a strong 30-year bond auction. Higher yields also brought in fresh buyers, who snapped up cheapened bonds, betting that the recent selloff may have run its course.</br></br>The gains came as a relief for many market participants after the violent rout in the previous two sessions. The benchmark 10-year note's yield, which moves inversely to its price, jumped on Wednesday to the highest level since June as President Barack Obama's tax-cut deal with Republicans in Congress boosted bets on higher economic growth and higher budget deficits, a double whammy for the Treasury market.</br></br>""The auction went really well, and I think the bond market is stabilizing,"" said Chris Sullivan, who oversees $1.65 billion as chief investment officer in New York at the United Nations Federal Credit Union. ""Bond yields have more room to fall back."""
"Profit-takers knocked the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower in nervous trading ahead of today's employment report. Bond prices rose, and the dollar strengthened.</br></br>The industrial average slid 8.58 points to 3544.87. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.36 to 452.49, but the Nasdaq Composite Index edged up 0.36 to 706.22.</br></br>Analysts said stock market investors took the opportunity to sell some shares at a profit after the surge in prices earlier this week. The analysts added that investors are strikingly fickle lately as they await clearer signs on the economy and inflation. As a result, individual stocks, and even entire groups, quickly fall in and out of favor.</br></br>""People are chasing butterflies,"" said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. ""When lightning strikes, everyone jumps to where it is, and when it calms down they go somewhere else.""</br></br>Investors will scrutinize today's employment report for a hint of the economy's health. But Mr. Metz argued that signs of an improving labor picture may not lift stock prices significantly. ""The stock market has already priced in a strong earnings outlook for the balance of the year,"" he said."
"The collapse of the stock market -- of any stock market -- is one of the few truly predictable events in this life. With remarkable certainty, we know that prices will rise to ridiculous peaks and then plunge or collapse to ridiculous lows. The timing, alas, is a mystery. We have learned, however, that just before crashes and prolonged bear markets, the country often gets happy, even giddy over the market's doing so well so long. Shrewd market watchers take this as the surest sign that a bull market is in the throes of death, even before the decline becomes visible.</br></br>Maury Klein's Rainbow's End recounts the national zaniness that coincided with the decision by millions of Americans to step into the stock market for the first time in the mid- and late 1920s. Many argued that the country's economy had entered a ""new era of prosperity,"" as President Calvin Coolidge expressed it. Who, after all, could argue with what Frederick Lewis Allen later called ""a ceaseless flow of new delights"": the automobile, the telephone, movies, radios, refrigerators, record players? In corporate boardrooms, something called ""scientific management"" was taking hold to replace the apparently unscientific management of days gone by, when managers simply did what they thought would make money.</br></br>For the first time in the 1920s, Wall Street firms marketed stocks to the public en masse. The number of ""investment trusts,"" the precursors to today's mutual funds, increased sixfold, with more attention paid to the big names running the funds than to the funds' potential risks and benefits. The number of Americans owning stocks shot from about 500,000 to 15 million. On Oct. 15, 1929, Yale professor Irving Fisher declared (infamously, in hindsight) that ""stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau."" Nine days later, the Dow Jones Industrial Average began a long and steep plunge that stripped the market of 40 percent of its value in three weeks and continued, with a few interruptions, into 1932. ""All I lost was two hundred and forty thousand dollars,"" Groucho Marx said later. ""I would have lost more but that was all the money I had.""</br></br>The apparent parallels between the period before the crash of 1929 (the New Era) and the period that led to the market collapse of 2000 and early 2001 (the New Economy) are obvious and have been noted ad nauseum anecdotally in the financial press for two years. Klein, a historian of business and finance, evidently thought it beyond his mission to use the opportunity to explore the similarities, which would have made the book more pointed and useful as a vivid reminder of the ever-present risks intrinsic to equities, which are casually ignored as professionals strive to keep alive the mythology that however bleak the moment, everything will be fine if investors just hold on long enough. One wonders how many investors are aware that after 1929, the Dow didn't regain its pre-crash level until 1954. Twenty-five years is a lot of holding on.</br></br>Klein's book is not the best place to absorb the market's history. It's painfully slow. It advances no particularly new angles or theories. In its lack of analysis, it doesn't demonstrate why the crash is a ""pivotal moment"" in American history fit for inclusion in the Oxford University Press's series of the same name. The author could not resist the common tendency to see every event as either causal or emblematic of the main event of the '29 crash. Klein suggests, for example, that the fad of flagpole sitting and the craze for flying in the '20s were somehow symbolic of the idea that the market could defy gravity. He is equally unconvincing in his efforts to connect everyone from Babe Ruth to evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson to a ""mood"" of ""escapism"" somehow connected with the stock market."
"NEW YORK, April 10-Takeover news and speculation provided almost all of the action today as the stock market turned in a mixed showing in auiet tradine.</br></br>Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks.</br></br>Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 123.9 million shares, down from 156.9 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional ' exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, tQtaled 150.6 million shares.</br></br>Most analysts believe economic growth has begun to slow since the early weeks of the year. But hopes persisted among traders that the slowdown wouldn‰Ûªt stop most companies from posting healthy earnings gains for the January-March quarter.</br></br>- At the same time, market participants were looking ahead a bit warily to the monthly report on the producer price index, due from the government on Friday."
"NEW YORK, Dec. 14-Blue-chip stocks tacked up strong gains today as news of moderate inflation eased fears that the Federal Reserve would increase interest rates again next week.</br></br>After losing more than 54 points last week, the blue-chip index has gained 55 points so far this week.</br></br>In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 2 to 1 on active trading of more than 354 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</br></br>A modest rise of 0.3 percent in November‰Ûªs consumer price index indicated the economy is growing steadily with only moderate inflation, analysts said.</br></br>A jump in the CPI would have increased chances that the Fed would raise interest rates at its policy-making meeting Tuesday, analysts said. The central bank has pushed up lending rates six times this year to curb inflationary pressures."
"On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 200 points, sliding past the 10 percent threshold marking an official correction from its October peak. Talk of recession intensified. But two days later, the market rallied, soaring more than 300 points to its biggest one-day percentage gain in at least four years.</br></br>The wild swings agitated investors. Should they sell their stocks? Should they move to less risky bonds, certificates of deposit and money-market funds? Or should they sit tight and ride out the turbulence? ""When everything is uncertain, you just don't know where to put your money,"" said Michael Fekete, a Northwest D.C. resident and technical editor who has about $350,000 in stocks, bonds and other investments. ""Where do you hide?""</br></br>Wall Street is bracing for an even rockier period of further deterioration in credit conditions and the housing market. The dollar remains weak and oil prices high. Poor corporate earnings are also dogging the economy. A second consecutive quarter of declining profits could lead to an ""earnings recession,"" which some analysts say could prompt staff cuts, driving up the unemployment rate and further dampening consumer spending.</br></br>""These times are very volatile, so it is scary . . .,"" said Rita Cheng, a financial adviser at Ameriprise Financial Services in Bethesda. ""Investors have every right to be nervous. The advice that I give to clients is you don't want to panic.""</br></br>Still, Fekete, one of Cheng's clients, recently dumped some poor performers from his portfolio. He is not ruling out more changes but said, ""I think we're just going to sit tight right now and see how that does."""
"The Federal Reserve Board's rate cut yesterday increased the chances that months of Fed moves could start to trickle down to homeowners in time to ease the pain when adjustable-rate mortgages reset this year. And people who borrow money to pay tuition, buy cars or cover unpaid credit card bills might eventually see some benefit.</br></br>But the Fed's action could also revive inflation, many economists fear. By reducing the interest rate financial institutions charge each other for short-term loans, the Fed makes money more readily and cheaply available. If it miscalculates, it can pump too much money into the economy, fueling excessive demand for goods, housing and capital spending -- and driving up prices.</br></br>That would undermine Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke's long-cherished notion of setting a low, narrow and predictable target range for inflation. Through higher consumer prices, all Americans would effectively help pay for the rescue of the financial industry. The decline in housing prices might be tempered, but inflation would eat away at real housing values.</br></br>""The good news is that this will take pressure off of housing prices,"" said Kenneth Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard University. ""The bad news is that it will be very painful to squeeze the inflation out of the system when this mess is all over.""</br></br>The threat of inflation was evident in commodity markets yesterday. Though at historically high levels, prices for corn and copper rose on the expectation that the Fed rate cut would breathe new life into the economy and avert a drop in demand. Oil prices jumped more than $3 in New York to $109.42 a barrel."
"AT A TIME when the country's biggest companies are abruptly laying off longtime employees by the thousands, it's not surprising that Americans' thinking about jobs and job loyalty is changing. Labor Day this year is distinguished by the realization that the present churning in the job market is not temporary but probably will continue.</br></br>For most of the past half-century, large corporations provided much of the middle class with a high degree of security - including a tacit promise that the employee who performed well would stay on the payroll until retirement. In the past decade's epidemic of mergers, reorganizations and productivity drives, that promise has all but vanished. It's uncertainty rather than actual unemployment that is generating the growing sense of insecurity in this country.</br></br>Unemployment is, fortunately, falling. The great American job- creating machine, stuck in neutral for several years, is now back at work. During the past year the labor force has grown by a million people, but the number of jobs increased by 2 million. The result was that unemployment came down by a million, and the unemployment rate fell from 7.6 percent of the labor force in August 1992 to 6.7 percent last month.</br></br>That's a remarkable achievement and reassuring. So why do consumer surveys continue to show high levels of uneasiness and caution?</br></br>Part of it is that earnings aren't moving much. There has been some increase in average compensation during the past year, but most of it has been in fringe benefits - particularly the soaring costs of health insurance. Cash wages and salaries haven't quite kept up with inflation, and that has hurt."
"Short interest at the Nasdaq Stock Market reached its highest point in four months, as the market's composite index dropped.</br></br>The number of short-selling positions not yet closed out edged up 1% to 4,124,763,193 shares in the month through April 15 -- up from 4,085,825,647 shares on March 15.</br></br>Investors who sell securities ""short"" borrow stock and sell it, betting the stock's price will fall, and they will be able to buy the shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender. Short interest often is considered an indication of the level of skepticism in the market. Short interest reflects the number of shares that have yet to be repurchased to give back to lenders. In general, the higher the short interest, the more people are expecting a downturn.</br></br>Some investors will allocate part of their portfolio to a professional short seller to hedge, or protect, their assets in case the market falls. Investors also may rely on short selling for other purposes, including a hedging strategy related to corporate mergers and acquisitions, hedging convertible securities and options, or tax-related reasons.</br></br>The next Nasdaq short-selling report will be published in The Wall Street Journal on May 27."
"It is earnings season again - that quarterly exercise in futility when investors not only have to figure out how a company did but also how a company did in comparison to what Wall Street was expecting it to do.</br></br>Here's a rule of thumb on how stocks will react to earnings reports, as seen by a top Wall Street trader. ""If there is any disappointment, your stock gets shot. If your earnings are what were expected, your stock gets maimed. Only if earnings are substantially better than expected does a stock go up,"" he explained.</br></br>Take Intel Corp., for example. The electronics company reported excellent profits last week that were around what the pros were expecting. Nevertheless, the company's stock declined more than $1 per share on the day the profits were reported.</br></br>Some stocks aren't treated even that well. Merrill Lynch & Co. reported sharply higher earnings last week. And the profits were well above Wall Street expectations. Yet the brokerage firm's stock declined rather sharply the day of the announcement.</br></br>Stock prices are higher mainly because investors can't find what they consider a comparable return in any other investment. This is likely to continue until either interest rates rise to attractive levels or something happens to stocks that makes them unattractive."
"[Stories of Reinventing a Career]</br></br>These days, Kenneth J. Thygerson, a savings-and-loan executive who spent much of the 1980s trying to deregulate the industry, has no desire to return to his days in finance.</br></br>Before the collapse that changed the course of his career, the former economist from Northwestern University worked at the U.S. League of Savings for 11 years, served on a presidential commission on housing, held a post at Bank Western Savings & Loan in Denver, and became president of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., now known as Freddie Mac. While there, he and his team moved the institution closer to privatization and higher profitability.</br></br>The then-39-year-old's success drew industry praise and a job offer from the board of San Diego-based Imperial Corp. of America in 1985. The troubled holding company -- then made up of small savings and loans -- had suffered heavy losses from a portfolio made largely of fixed-rate mortgages that were losing money because of rising interest rates.</br></br>Mr. Thygerson took the job as a challenge -- along with a fourfold increase in pay -- feeling he'd already accomplished everything he'd set out to do at Freddie Mac. He pursued an aggressive investment strategy, including buying into bonds sold by Drexel Burnham Lambert. The new strategy paid off until the bond market collapsed and sent thrifts nationwide reeling. Imperial's own decline was accelerated by fraudulent auto loans. ""I was devastated,"" says Mr. Thygerson, who resigned from his post. ""I had never experienced failure."""
"President Richard Nixon appointed the first energy czars, John Love and later William Simon, in the wake of the 1973 gasoline shortage. Congress mandated a drug czar during the crack cocaine epidemic in 1982. And President Bill Clinton named Ira Magaziner his health czar to craft legislation in 1993.</br></br>It's hardly a record of success; problems persist in all those areas. But with the automobile companies in crisis and the public tired of providing bailouts for American corporations, Congress and the Bush administration are on the verge of creating a new czar or committee to oversee efforts to rescue Detroit's largest automakers.</br></br>""If they can no longer pay their own way, it is entirely appropriate for someone to put the hammer down and say 'That's it,' "" said Richard Breeden, former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the court-appointed monitor for the scandal-ridden communications giant, WorldCom. ""If taxpayers are going to support General Motors, let's turn General Motors into a company worthy of it.""</br></br>The choice of a czar -- or czarina -- is the plan's first obstacle. President Bush, who would appoint the czar or overseers, and Democratic leaders in Congress have very different ideas about who would make the best choice.</br></br>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) mentioned former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker as the type of person she would support. As he exited an hour-long meeting with House Democrats yesterday afternoon, Volcker waved off reporters' questions, declining to state whether he was interested in the post. Volcker has already been tapped to advise President-elect Barack Obama on economic issues."
"Corporate profits have been getting a boost recently from a surprising source -- the surging stock market's effect on the value of corporate pension funds. These pension plans, once a drag on earnings, are boosting the financial performance of many of the country's best-known companies.</br></br>The pension-fund bubble stems from the arcane accounting rules that govern the more than $1 trillion in private pensions. Under those rules, companies make assumptions about how much they will earn on their pension assets, how much they will have to pay out to future retirees and the future level of interest rates.</br></br>But what has been happening during the long bull market is that those assumptions have proved too conservative -- and the funds have swollen far beyond expectations as stock market returns have outpaced historical trends.</br></br>The excess, filtered through many layers of accounting, is dribbling down to the bottom line. And that's giving an extra boost to corporate profits at a time when earnings are being squeezed from lack of pricing power and rising wage pressures. Some companies are siphoning off some of the pension surplus to pay for other corporate needs, such as early-retirement plans, retiree health benefits and even merger financing.</br></br>For many businesses, the gain is twofold: Their plans are so flush they are being spared from having to make new annual contributions, and they are earning income from the excess that has built up throughout the stock market's rise."
"Prices closed mixed on Wall Street today, bolstered by a stronger dollar and a recovery in Treasury bond prices, but buffeted by program trading and profit taking.</br></br>Big Board volume totaled 179.84 million shares, compared with 186.41 million in the previous session.</br></br>The Dow Jones average changed direction several times during the session while the margin of gainers to losers remained narrow.</br></br>""It's a battle of bargain hunters versus profit takers. The bargain hunters won in blue chips, and profit takers won elsewhere,"" said Michael Metz, a stock market analyst with Oppenheimer & Co.</br></br>They said the market took strength during the session from the stronger dollar and improvement in bond prices. On Tuesday, when the Dow Jones average tumbled more than 44 points, the decline was attributed to a weaker dollar and lower bonds."

"David Ellison took about three years to go from serving customers as a bank teller in upstate New York to helping Peter Lynch pick financial stocks in the 1980s for the Fidelity Magellan Fund, the biggest U.S. equity fund of the time.</br></br>""They saw I had bank experience on my resume so they said, you're the banking analyst,"" Ellison said in an interview.

The $646 million FBR Small Cap Financial Fund has risen at an annual rate of 22 percent since April 1999, led by holdings in companies including Washington Federal Inc. and Hawthorne Financial Corp.</br></br>The banking industry and funds that own financial stocks have benefited from an increase in corporate takeovers and the lowest interest rates in 45 years, Ellison said. Lynch, 60, who quit as manager of the Magellan fund in 1990, taught Ellison to separate good companies from bad companies, and to maintain confidence in his stock picks even if the share prices dropped.</br></br>Ellison focuses on companies with market values of less than $3 billion that have a low cost of capital and a low ratio of expenses to assets, rather than on companies that are reporting the highest revenue growth.

"Would you believe, on the Fourth of July, that the pursuit of liberty is taking Americans toward the envious contemplation of Fidel Castro‰Ûªs Cubans and King George‰Ûªs Hessians as models for the kind of allies that the United States now needs in the world?</br></br>This administration, you see, has the containment of Soviet power very much in mind. Some parts of it also have very much in mind rolling back Soviet power, at least rolling it back from places where it was settled in the post-Vietnam years. But who is going to do the fighting that these tasks may require if the locals can‰Ûªt manage on their own?</br></br>The problem, for those who accept administration premises, is that Vietnam soured most Americans on foreign interventions. Richard Nixon then tried to rely on regional powers; the shah‰Ûªs demise showed the limits here. Jimmy Carter organized a search for diplomatic solutions, and fell short. Ronald Reagan has applied American muscle‰ÛÓindirectly‰ÛÓto the containment-rollback policy that sometimes goes under the name of the Reagan Doctrine; nowhere, however, is success in sight.</br></br>Earlier, the Reagan administration did launch interventions. Grenada was a small success, Lebanon a medium-sized failure. But together they had a larger, unanticipated effect. They led Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger to lay down what has become administration law on interventions: the only ones permissible are the quick sure things. In practice, that means no more interventions, though accidents and alarms can never be ruled out.</br></br>The Reagan Doctrine plus the Weinberger Doctrine makes for a truly bad matchup of ends and means. The first promises active pursuit of ambitious goals, and the second ensures a measure of self-restraint that, if it were being shown by Jimmy Carter, would be denounced by the Reaganites as a sellout. The resulting policy tells friends and foes alike that, for all its bold talk, this administration will go only so far."

"These two themes struck me as I read The Washington Post's ""Being a Black Man"" series. I was impressed with how the young black men profiled in the series acknowledged their plight and assumed responsibility for it. Their unsentimental realism contrasts sharply with the persistent victim arguments of the experts and specialists interviewed for the series, and those of many academics and social scientists, white and black alike, who think they understand black men and the solutions to their problems.</br></br>The Post's survey found that 60 percent of black men attribute their plight to their own personal failures and attitudes rather than to racism. They do not underplay the persistence of racism in the United States, but they refuse to explain away their troubles by blaming the system.</br></br>It is heartening to see that young black men, even more than whites, think that to ""blame things on other people"" is not only a false take on reality but a sure way to guarantee failure. The men interviewed repeatedly made the point that viewing the world as a victim can be self-fulfilling. Most telling is Rahsaan Ferguson's account of his father's mantra, ""You are a black boy. That's two things you will always have against you."" This, Rahsaan fortunately came to realize, was terribly disabling advice: ""It kind of brings you down,"" he said. Indeed.</br></br>Rahsaan's father, nonetheless, can be forgiven for so badly misadvising his son, because his views are consistent with those of most members of the academic and professional community who interpret or work with blacks. Among such professionals, the overwhelming dogma is that blacks are victims and that racism -- personal and institutional -- is the main explanation for their troubles. It is striking that an overwhelming majority of the professional analysts interviewed for the series emphasized victimhood in their explanations.</br></br>""Even successful black men are victims of this crisis,"" argued Courtland Lee, a University of Maryland professor and former editor of the Journal of African American Men, in one of The Post's articles. ""They know they walk around with a target on their backs."""
"The number of self-reported million-dollar earners in Maryland has dropped by roughly a third compared with this time last year, renewing debate yesterday about whether the state's year-old ""millionaires' tax"" is driving rich people beyond its borders.</br></br>The data from April's tax filings, released by the comptroller's office, came with a couple of big caveats. At least part of the drop-off in Marylanders whose returns showed more than $1 million in taxable income was certainly due to the recession and the decline it has brought in earnings from capital gains and real estate. And the figures do not include taxpayers who filed for extensions.</br></br>Still, the ""substantial decline"" in million-dollar earners filing on time was enough for the comptroller's office to announce that it will ""be thoroughly analyzing these returns and their implications."" And it was enough for opponents of the state's new surcharge to say, in essence, ""I told you so."" ""I don't think anyone can dispute that some people have left Maryland,"" said Senate Minority Leader Allan H. Kittleman (R-Howard). ""That's what we were trying to explain when we were voting on this.""</br></br>Among the skeptics, however, was Warren Descheneaux, the chief fiscal adviser to the legislature, which last year raised the state's top marginal tax rate, applied to income above $1 million, from 5.5 percent to 6.25 percent.</br></br>The new rate, which is set to expire after three years, was expected to affect roughly 6,000 taxpayers, about 40 percent of whom reside in Montgomery County, based on the previous year's tax data."

J. Lawrence Inc., New York. ""It's putting us on notice that the {business} cycle's having its effect.""</br></br>Mr. Rubel added that such negative-sounding airline news as Pan American World Airways' closure actually tend to cheer Boeing investors, because strong Boeing customers become healthier with the disappearance of marginal players prone to cutting fares."

"At the Buster Brown children's clothing factory in Coeburn, Va., manager Joe Gillespie speaks the sort of language unheard for years in the coal fields counties of Southwest Virginia: ""We've hired 60 people in the last two months and we plan on hiring another 60 in the next few months.""</br></br>Almost unnoticed, the economy of the chronically depressed counties along the Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia borders has begun to stir for the first time since a worldwide boom in coal peaked in 1982.</br></br>Shopping centers are under construction in St. Paul and Norton. Outside Lebanon, Mattaco Inc. has put 65 people to work making parts for automobile cruise-control mechanisms destined for new Fords, a figure that will rise to 150 as soon as the company can get additional production machinery up and running.</br></br>Meanwhile, since the region's rugged landscape makes it hard to find enough flat land for a house, much less a factory site, a remote mountaintop is being leveled in Buchanan County to accommodate a new $32 million state prison that eventually will provide about 350 new jobs and an annual payroll of $7 million.</br></br>The new prison, which was ordered put in Buchanan County by Gov.

"To allow myself more time for gamming. I don't dissipate my energy thinking about the real world. I let Post columnist George Will do it for me.

Gambling, he said, is an activity that debases our society and corrupts its citizens.</br></br>In Connecticut, money raised by gambling helps the state avoid instituting an income lax. but even that did not mollify the columnist. To Will, gambling is a regressive revenue-raising device Hint draws money disproportionately from ""minority and poor populations that can ill afford to gamble. . . and have little understanding of the probability of losses.‰Û</br></br>This argument seems slightly out of character for the man who regularly chides government bureaucrats bent on protecting the masses from themselves, for the sake of their own good. Will displays this very sort of contemptuous paternalism in his view of gamblers, pitying the poor souls w.lio throw away their rent money on ""lotteries in which more than 99.9 percent of all players are losers.‰Û</br></br>No matter that this indulgence buys a bit of entertainment, excitement and optimism for people with a 0.0 percent chance of working within Hie capitalist system to make a lot of money.

"As the Federal Reserve approaches a key policy-making meeting next week, the two measures of the money supply it watches most closely remain within the target ranges set for them, according to figures released yesterday.</br></br>The Fed reported that Ml, the measure of money that includes currency and travelers checks in circulation and checking deposits at financial institutions, rose $11.5 billion last month to an average level of $545.4 billion. The June increase meant that Ml is rising at an annual rate of about 7J/2 percent from its average in the fourth quarter of 1983. The Fed‰Ûªs target is to get growth of 4 percent to 8 percent between that quarter and the final three months of 1984.</br></br>M2, a broader measure that also includes savings and small time deposits, money market mutual fund shares and some other items, rose $13.7 billion to a level of $2,273 trillion. Its growth rate over the same period is 7.2 percent, slightly below the midpoint of its target range of 6 percent to 9 percent year-to-year growth.</br></br>target, M3, remained above the upper limit of its range. M3, wliich also includes large time deposits and other items, reached a level of $2,836 trillion, up $20.3 billion from the May level. [See Fed tables, D5]</br></br>Financial analysts remain divided over whether the Fed's policy-making group, the Federal Open Market Committee, can be expected to tighten credit conditions when it meets Monday and Tuesday.

"Dayton Hudson Corp. reduced its capital spending plans for fiscal 1988 by 25% from this year's level and said it would concentrate on improving its sagging earnings.</br></br>The move marks a shift in strategy for the Minneapolis-based retailer, which has sacrificed profits over the past two years to lead the industry in capital spending. Last month, however, Dayton Hudson narrowly escaped a hostile takeover; the experience apparently influenced it to focus harder on its short-term earnings.</br></br>At a news conference in New York, the company said for the year ending Jan. 28, 1989 it would invest about $600 million in new facilities, remodeling projects and new technology, compared with $800 million this year. The move also represents a retreat from the company's plans earlier this year to spend $5 billion between 1987 and 1991.</br></br>Dayton Hudson cited the uncertain outlook for consumer spending as one factor in its decision. But some analysts attributed it mainly to internal problems. ""I think there are reasons for their scaling back that have to do with more than just the economy,"" said William Smith of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.</br></br>The company, once considered among the best-run retailers in the nation, has been hurt in recent years by merchandising errors at its rapidly-expanding Mervyn's department store unit. Analysts believe management was slow to recognize the problems at Mervyn's and too optimistic in predicting a turnaround. As a result, Dayton Hudson's earnings from continuing operations declined 9% in fiscal 1986 to $2.62 a share and Mr. Smith predicted the figure could fall an additional 8% to $2.40 a share this year."
"WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve policy makers unanimously decided in mid-May to hold interest rates steady amid signs that the recession was ending, the central bank disclosed.</br></br>The Fed hasn't made a move to alter rates since the end of April, and wasn't expected to change that stance at a closed-door meeting last Tuesday and Wednesday.</br></br>A summary of the May 14 meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee noted that some policy makers wanted to leave the door open for another round of rate reductions. These officials, unsure that the economy was recovering, argued that the risks of keeping too tight a grip on credit exceeded the risks of being too generous.</br></br>No one formally dissented from the consensus, so the officials' identities weren't disclosed. The summary was released Friday after the customary six-week delay.</br></br>Several Fed policy makers stressed the importance of maintaining a steadily growing money supply in order to fuel an economic recovery, the summary said. The issue was revisited last week when the committee was to set money-supply growth targets for 1992. The targets will be disclosed when Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan testifies before Congress next week."

"{An Editorial Series}</br></br>Far from being an impregnable fortress of ""uncontrollables,"" the federal budget is a mountain of fat. As this series has detailed, program after program could be cut to the long-term benefit of even their intended beneficiaries. If the Grace Commission recommendations were enacted tomorrow, government services would be delivered more efficiently across the board. If Pentagon cuts pared bloated staffs, we would have a leaner and meaner military. Cutting subsidies would give us a stronger farm sector, better transportation and so on. While we hesitate to mention it when middle-class welfare has scarcely been dented, in many ways the poverty programs have proved a burden on the poor.</br></br>The only ""uncontrollable"" has been Congress, locked in a mirage of ""political reality"" and structured into petty fiefdoms guaranteeing indiscipline and inertia. On this front, the 1985 session offers at least a glimmer of hope. Buoyed by the resounding defeat of the last New Deal Democrat, the Republican administration will present a budget that at least offers a menu of budget reductions. In Robert Dole, the Republican Senate has a new activist leader who will go beyond the consensus of his colleagues and try to make his own mark -- a positive development even if we disagree with some of his ideas. On the budget, political will is starting to bud.</br></br>We fear, though, that these tender buds will be nipped in a fit of ignorance and misunderstanding. While there is now an inchoate recognition that the budget needs to be cut, there is no cogent rationale of why. This will both lead to a splintering of the potential political coalition, and focus attention on the least meaningful kind of savings. The problem is that no one actually talks about cutting expenditures. Instead, everyone talks only of cutting the deficit.</br></br>This rhetoric is bound to raise the suspicions of the supply-siders, ourselves included, for it has historically been a code word for raising taxes. As Alan Reynolds records nearby, this is a proven prescription for stagnation of both the economy and the government. (See: ""Less Will Get You More"" -- WSJ Jan. 23, 1985) It has been fashionable lately to calculate how much economic growth would be needed to eliminate the deficit with no increase in taxes. No one bothers to calculate what it would take to eliminate the deficit by raising taxes with no economic growth, though this clearly would be even more ""unrealistic""; nothing produces deficits like recession. In any anti-deficit strategy growth remains the key, and growth is not promoted by higher taxes."
"LONDON -- For investors looking abroad these days, the tune is: Jack be nimble, Jack be quick. Choose a money manager who can make the right stock pick.</br></br>Performance data on international portfolio managers indicate that when investing outside the U.S., lately it has been more profitable to go with so-called active managers who are free to pick and choose among individual stock markets and stocks rather than merely mimic an overall index.</br></br>Last year, U.S. pension funds that invest in foreign stocks posted a median 6.7% return, compared with a 1.9% total return (price appreciation plus dividends paid) for the benchmark Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe Australasia Far East (EAFE) index of 21 major overseas markets, according to InterSec Research Corp. of Stamford, Conn.</br></br>Active managers have beaten the index in seven of the past 10 years, InterSec says. The trend held last year for mutual funds as well. The average return of 410 actively managed international mutual funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services was 5.7%.</br></br>These results might make some investors sneer, compared with last year's 31% rise in the U.S. market, as measured by Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the third consecutive year of outsize U.S. stock returns."
"Merrill Lynch & Co., taking strong medicine to deal with a weak market, announced one of the steepest retrenchments on Wall Street in recent years.</br></br>The nation's largest securities firm said it will take a $2.2 billion fourth-quarter charge partly to pay for about 9,000 job cuts it says were necessary to reduce expenses amid a business slowdown. Though the restructuring was expected -- The Wall Street Journal reported on the large potential job cuts and charge in October -- yesterday was the first time Merrill confirmed the move.</br></br>Merrill says the work-force reduction is part of a plan to cut costs by $1.4 billion a year, a move it hopes will boost profitability. Most of the job cuts, representing nearly 14% of its work force, came in the last three months of 2001. In total, the firm cut 15,000 positions in 2000 and now employs about 57,000 people. About $1.2 billion of the charge is related to staff severance costs.</br></br>""The nature of this process we don't anticipate repeating,"" Thomas Patrick, Merrill's chief financial officer told analysts yesterday in a conference call.</br></br>The charge came as no surprise to investors. In a recent research note, Bear Stearns Cos. analyst Amy Butte predicted a charge of as much as $2.1 billion was in the works. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Merrill shares were up $1.49, or 2.6%, to $57.93."

"WASHINGTON -- The U.S. has a greatly strengthened hand as Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen heads to London for tomorrow's meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the seven largest industrialized nations.</br></br>In his first meeting with his counterparts from the other Group of Seven nations, Mr. Bentsen is almost certain to argue that the U.S. is finally doing what its allies have demanded: Raising taxes to shrink its budget deficit, helping to reduce pressure on world interest rates and ease inflationary fears.</br></br>In exchange, the U.S. is likely to argue, the Japanese and Germans should do their part to enhance the prospects for world economic growth. From Japan, the U.S. wants stepped-up government spending to stimulate its economy. And from Germany, it wants lower interest rates from the Bundesbank, which would probably require some fiscal belt-tightening by the German government.</br></br>""As I've talked to finance ministers from other parts of the world . . . they are impressed with what we have done,"" Mr. Bentsen told a congressional hearing this week. ""I believe that puts us in a stronger leadership role when we get to deal with these other countries and trying to develop . . . sustained growth in other markets that will be buying our products.""</br></br>Robert Hormats, a Clinton backer who is vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs International, says Mr. Bentsen goes to London ""in the strongest position of any U.S. Treasury secretary in a G-7 meeting for a decade."""
"The impact of the two-day-old pilots strike at Northwest Airlines will deepen today as employers in the markets it dominates return to work with few travel options.</br></br>Business travelers from Detroit and Minneapolis raced home Friday night to beat the midnight deadline for the strike. But as Sharon Yourth, a regional manager for Baxter International Inc., said upon returning that night to Detroit's airport: ""What am I supposed to do next week?""</br></br>Now that next week has come, there is little hope of a quick resolution. The two sides haven't talked since the pilots walked out early Saturday. And Maggie Jacobsen, the federal mediator who supervised the talks, said in an interview that she had no plans at the moment to recommend that President Clinton invoke a rarely used law that would put the pilots back to work for 60 days, while a special panel investigates the deadlock.</br></br>In Detroit, where Northwest controls 75% of the flights, General Motors Corp. is instructing its employees to drive to Buffalo, N.Y., and Dayton, Ohio, to find a plane. Still, the auto maker expects that the strike means about 20% of its planned business trips cannot be made.</br></br>The situation is worse in Minnesota's Twin Cities, where Northwest controls about 80% of the gates at Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport. Unlike Detroit, Minneapolis isn't located near other big cities, leaving big companies such as Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co. and Dayton Hudson Corp. with no easy backup plan."
"Some non-Internet stocks that managed to crash the Internet party have been finding that they, too, have got a splitting hangover.</br></br>Take CheckFree Holdings. The Norcross, Ga., company earns most of its money from electronic bill-payment services and from software used by financial institutions, businesses that existed long before the Internet.</br></br>But CheckFree's Internet bill-paying service is growing rapidly. Around the start of the year, investors embraced CheckFree as a back-door play on the blazing-hot Internet. By April 14, the stock soared to an intraday high of 69 1/8, up from 23 3/8 at the end of 1998.</br></br>Since then, CheckFree has continued trading like an Internet stock: It fell like a rock to as low as 33 5/8, and closed yesterday at 38 3/8, up 1 1/8 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. This 44% decline -- despite a recent rebound in sympathy with the Internet stocks -- is a bit steeper than those of Internet bellwethers America Online and Yahoo! in the same period. That is even though CheckFree, unlike them, has plenty of non-Internet revenue and -- egad! -- even non-Internet earnings, to buoy it.</br></br>Since the air started leaking out of the Internet bubble in April, it has been something of a mixed blessing for companies once tagged as backdoor plays on the Internet. Such companies can still garner a higher price-earnings ratio than run-of-the-mill enterprises with no Internet connection."

"As its final hours of solvency ticked away Monday night, Drexel Burnham Lambert's top executives still clung to the hope that the Bush administration would send some signal that it wanted the beleaguered Wall Street firm to survive. Such a signal might coax worried bankers and lenders to give Drexel more breathing room in meeting hundreds of millions of dollars in loan obligations.</br></br>But late Monday, Drexel got a different message. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard C. Breeden and E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York-two officials who might have led a rescue party for Drexel-telephoned to say that no help was coming, according to sources close to the discussions.</br></br>Breeden told Drexel Chief Executive Frederick Joseph that senior Bush administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, had concluded that the best step for Drexel and the financial markets was a bankruptcy filing, the sources said. To delay would only add to the risk that Drexel's financial plight would shake investor confidence, causing a much wider, more dangerous problem for Wall Street, Breeden reportedly told Joseph. At the same time, Breeden acknowledged that the decision was up to Drexel's board of directors.</br></br>The next day, Drexel threw in the towel, announcing first that it was defaulting on $100 million in loans, and later, that the parent company was filing for bankruptcy protection-a preliminary step toward an expected dissolution of the firm.</br></br>Thus, the Bush administration added another chapter to the longstanding, often hostile relationship between Wall Street and Washington."

"Uninsured Washington area residents shopping for health coverage -- or convinced they have to go without -- have a new tool to help them assess the options available to them. A Web site first developed for California by the nonprofit Foundation for Health Coverage Education now includes information specific to all 50 states and the District. The same information is available via a toll-free hotline for people using a phone rather than a computer.</br></br>While the information on the site isn't new -- several consumer groups have compiled essentially the same facts -- its interactive format lets users shortcut through complexities to personalized options much more quickly and easily. The foundation, funded largely by the insurance industry, argues that the oft-cited figure of 43 million uninsured Americans includes many people who don't know of the choices available to them.</br></br>Once a user identifies his state of residence, both the Web site and phone line use five simple questions to gauge a person's eligibility for public and private health plans open to those not covered by employers.</br></br>For example, if you report that you and your teenage son live in Washington, have no insurance and have a monthly income of $2,000, one plan you'll hear about will be the DC Healthy Families initiative, which provides health insurance to low-income children and their parents. The Web site also provides links to printable applications for many plans and phone numbers for insurers and government agencies.</br></br>Consumer advocates for the uninsured said they welcome any additional tools that could help people find insurance."

On a per person basis, real wealth rose 6.7 percent, just over half a percent a year.</br></br>In addition, compared to earlier 10-year periods, the numbers in a new report by the Federal Reserve paint a stark picture.

"When it comes to personal-income levels in Texas, the gap between the rich cities and the poor cities is continuing to widen.</br></br>Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antonio registered the biggest gains in per capita income, while the border towns slowed sluggish increases. Per capita income growth is a key economic indicator. When incomes rise briskly, people have more money to spend on everything from restaurant food to housing.</br></br>In Houston, personal income soared 5.8% in the first quarter over a year earlier as the city's economy rebounded from the low oil prices of 1999. Dallas, which wasn't particularly affected by low oil prices, still saw a strong 5.2% rise during the same period. And in Austin, the hottest economy of all in Texas, incomes gained 4.6% over a year earlier. San Antonio, long a bastion of stable growth, posted a 4% improvement.</br></br>""The strength in the state remains in those large cities,"" says economist Toni Horst of Economy.com (formerly RFA Dismal Sciences Inc., West Chester, Pa.), which compiles the data. ""That's where the growth is taking place. And that's where you're going to see the income growth.""</br></br>The bigger border cities didn't fare nearly as well. Even though most of them are growing rapidly, they aren't adding high-paying jobs like the big four Texas cities."
"WASHINGTON -- The General Accounting Office estimates that the Pentagon netted a windfall of $35 billion in fiscal 1982 through 1985 by using excessive inflation projections in budget planning.</br></br>The surplus, which is higher than most earlier estimates, occurred because the annual inflation rates were lower than government economists projected in those years. According to a GAO study, the Pentagon redirected most of the funds to weapons programs and personnel pay raises. The study, requested by Chairman Les Aspin (D., Wis.) of the House Armed Services committee, calls for steps to ensure that the Defense Department doesn't receive excessive funds to cover inflation in the future.</br></br>The report, which the GAO is expected to release later this month after the Pentagon has submitted its comments, is likely to rekindle a debate over the defense budgeting process. Congressional staffers say some of the recommendations may lead to proposals to give lawmakers greater control over the Pentagon's inflation-accounting system. Congress is scheduled to take up the military appropriations bill for fiscal 1986, which begins Oct. 1, in the next few weeks.</br></br>The GAO report challenges a central premise underlying the Pentagon's system of budgeting for inflation: that weapons budgets should be based on separate, higher inflation assumptions than those for the rest of the federal budget. Since 1982, the Pentagon has based its requests for funds on the assumption that weapons prices would increase at a rate 30% higher than the inflation rate the government used in calculating the real gross national product, the inflation-adjusted value of the nation's output of goods and services.</br></br>However, the GAO analysis concludes that defense procurements ""increased at about the same rate as prices of all goods in the U.S. economy."""
"Bond prices drifted lower in sluggish activity yesterday, reacting mainly to a slightly lower dollar in the foreign exchange markets.</br></br>""The bond market is trading strictly on currencies now,"" said Peter Bass, a managing director at S.G. Warburg Securities Inc. ""This was one of the lightest trading days I can remember in a long while.""</br></br>Prices of long-term Treasury bonds fell about half a point, or about $5 for each $1,000 face amount. Corporates, municipals and mortgage-backed bonds also edged lower, while most short-term interest rates were little changed.</br></br>Somewhat to the surprise of many traders, there was hardly any reaction in the credit markets to growing U.S.-Iran tensions stemming from the U.S. downing of an Iranian airliner Sunday. Several analysts thought investors might rush to sell long-term bonds and buy the safest of all securities, short-term Treasury bills. Some also thought oil and gold prices would surge. But that speculation proved unfounded.</br></br>""I don't think the bond market reacted to the airline disaster at all,"" said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist and senior vice president at Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. Instead, he said, bonds reacted mainly to ""the dollar's failure to maintain its rise above the 135 level"" against the Japanese yen in overnight trading."
"WASHINGTON -- Some governors are pushing to scale back or kill proposals to expand Medicaid to provide health-care coverage to the uninsured, raising a new challenge to President Barack Obama's effort to overhaul the system.</br></br>Medicaid, the health-care program for the poor, is funded through a combination of federal and state tax money. Proposals in the House and Senate would expand the program to cover at least a third of the nation's 46 million uninsured, but states are worried they would get stuck with a big part of the tab.</br></br>Several governors, including Democratic Gov. Christine Gregoire of Washington and Republican Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi, plan to come to Washington this week to discuss health issues with White House and congressional officials. Medicaid is expected to be a primary topic.</br></br>""[W]e're wary of additional financial obligations when we're struggling to cover the obligations we have,"" said Jonathan Seib, a Gregoire health-policy adviser.</br></br>In private meetings, Senate Democrats working on health care have assured the governors that the federal government will assume all the costs for the expansion at first, followed by a transition to shared responsibility. House Democrats are pressing to have the federal government take on the full cost permanently."
"A so-so first-quarter earnings season hasn't dented investors' enthusiasm for stocks.</br></br>Profit at large U.S. companies modestly exceeded Wall Street analysts' expectations, while revenue was weak and many companies ratcheted down growth projections.</br></br>But stock prices have been rising, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 16% for the year and 4.2% since earnings season began April 8 with a mixed report from aluminum company Alcoa Inc.</br></br>The developments have added up to a rise in stock-market valuations. The price/earnings ratio on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index now stands at 14.5, its highest level since 2010.</br></br>Stock-rally skeptics said that spells trouble. They contend soft U.S. economic growth and expanding P/E multiples can't coexist forever. Economists predict U.S. gross domestic product will expand at a slower rate in the second quarter than the first, when it increased at a 2.5% annual rate. Government spending cuts known as the sequester came into effect March 1. The Labor Department said Thursday that initial jobless claims increased by 32,000 to a seasonally adjusted 360,000 in the week ended May 11, the largest one-week gain since November."
"Our economic policies are often promoted like a new car or deodorant: that is, they are oversold. So it is with the latest economic fad-greater saving. We're spendthrifts. We need to save more. George Bush says so. The Democrats say so. Gosh, Americans hardly save anything. In 1989, the personal savings rate amounted to a meager 5.5 percent of disposable income.</br></br>Now for the less startling truth. Of course, all prosperous nations must save and invest for the future. And Americans do. Indeed, the private savings and investment rates have been remarkably stable since the late 19th century. Even if government could easily induce Americans to save more-and that's not clear-higher living standards and faster economic growth wouldn't quickly result.</br></br>The great savings debate is mostly a political charade. President Bush and congressional Democrats are proposing separate plans to promote savings. Everyone wants to be seen as spurring the economy. The idea is to create a respectable pretext for enacting new tax relief for the middle class. If there's a savings ""problem,"" then tax ""incentives"" to cure it are justified. The trouble is that the new tax-free savings accounts would almost certainly end up reducing national savings.</br></br>Saving means putting off consuming today to invest in something that will enrich us tomorrow. The logic works for both nations and individuals, and our collective individual savings provide the funds for the nation's investments. But three myths mar the savings debate. Consider them.</br></br>Wrong. Between 1980 and 1988, the private savings rate averaged 16.7 percent of gross national product, down negligibly from the 16.8 percent average between 1950 and 1979. The main motive for distorting this trend is political. It is to create a ""problem"" that then must be ""solved."" The most common misrepresentation is to cite the personal savings rate-savings by individuals-which dropped from an average of 8 percent of disposable income in the 1970s to 5.4 percent in the 1980s."
"The boos and whistles began raining down on Helmut Kohl as soon as he mounted the stage in the market square of this dilapidated industrial city. When the chancellor of German unity began reciting his achievements, the chorus of catcalls nearly drowned out his amplified voice.</br></br>""Kohl must go! Kohl must go!"" chanted many protesters in the crowd of 1,000 people, who had come to a campaign rally Thursday night to hear Europe's longest-serving leader make his pitch for an unprecedented fifth term after 16 years in office. As police in riot gear shoved unruly demonstrators behind barricades, other spectators jeered and waved signs saying: ""Thanks for 20 percent unemployment"" and ""Enough with your broken promises!""</br></br>As he tours eastern Germany courting votes for the Sept. 27 national election, Kohl is confronting an ugly mood of disillusionment that has jeopardized his hopes for another comeback victory. Although some polls indicate he has narrowed the gap with Social Democratic rival Gerhard Schroeder to as little as 3 percentage points, the hostility Kohl encounters at nearly every stop in the east suggests he is making no headway in recapturing the allegiance of Germany's most fickle swing voters.</br></br>Four years ago, Kohl came from 18 points down to win reelection with the help of an avalanche of votes from easterners still grateful to the father of German unity for liberating them from the bleak repression they endured under the Communist authorities of the German Democratic Republic. The republic collapsed in 1990 along with other Soviet-backed Communist regimes, and its five regions, along with Berlin, were folded into the Federal Republic of Germany.</br></br>But rampant despair over widespread joblessness and embittered dismay with capitalist society have compelled many easterners to turn against Kohl with a vengeance. Many politicians and commentators now believe Kohl's Christian Democrats could tumble to third place in the east, behind Schroeder's Social Democrats and the former Communists known as the Party of Democratic Socialism."
"The title of a new book by Betty Friedan was incorrect in Judy Mann's column yesterday. It is ""The Fountain of Age.""

He continues to go to French class once a week. He has a lively social life. We consider him exceptional.

This group of people is redefining aging, and it is no surprise to find Betty Friedan in the vanguard. At 72, she has just published ""The Fountain of Youth,"" a book on which she has spent a decade working. It will liberate us from the tyranny of youth as surely as ""The Feminine Mystique"" liberated women from the calcified gender role of mother/sex object."

"The growth in economic output and productivity in this country trails that of other major industrial nations in large part because the United States devoted a much smaller share of its production to upgrading and expanding its manufacturing facilities, a Treasury Department study concludes.</br></br>Because of this disparity in investment, the ‰ÛÏabsolute level of superiority of U.S. productivity is rapidly diminishing,"" according to the study.</br></br>Treasury Department economists Herman I. Lie-bling and Julian Jaakson say that the lag in U.S. investment has ‰ÛÏeffectively lowered rates of advance in living standards of the average consumer in the U.S., created shortages in basic-mate-rials-producing industries during periods of economic expansion and added substantially to the inflationary' consequences of high employment in recent years.‰Û</br></br>Furthermore, it has ‰ÛÏlimited job opportunities in the sense that, had the growth of plant and equipment exceeded that of the labor force, more jobs would have been required to utilize that increased capacity.‰Û</br></br>Liebling and Jaakson argue that there is a strong correlation between the so-called investment ratio (the percentage of output a nation invests) and the growth of output."
"For people who always like to have something to worry about, here's the trendy new worry for 1998. Price deflation. What would happen to businesses, jobs and the stock market if average consumer prices dropped?</br></br>The answer: Things could be just fine. Obsessive brooders should exercise their worry beads over something else.</br></br>The consumer price index (CPI) falls when enough businesses cut the prices on things they sell, or when prices decline sharply for a couple of major items within the index.</br></br>The 12-month inflation rate is running at 1.8 percent.

"A prominent journalist wrote in 1947: ""The basic power determinant of any country is its steel production, and what makes this a great nation above all is the fact that it can roll over 90 million tons of steel ingots a year, more than Great Britain, prewar Germany, Japan, France, and the Soviet Union combined."" Well, that was then. In 2005 the United States ranked third in raw steel production. Its output (95 million metric tons) was behind Japan's (113 million tons) and less than a third of China's (349 million). So?</br></br>We are experiencing another competitiveness panic. These occur every 15 or 20 years. There's an outpouring of worried reports and articles. After Sputnik in 1957 -- the first artificial Earth satellite -- we were supposedly doomed to be overtaken by the Soviet Union. In the late 1970s and 1980s, it was Germany and then Japan. Lately, China and India have been the threats. Through it all, the United States has remained the dominant global economy, representing about one-fifth of the world's total output.</br></br>If it means keeping the lead in every industry where we once led, we're doomed. As other countries develop, they create larger and better industries to meet their needs. Steel is an example. The United States doesn't need 350 million tons of steel. Textiles, consumer electronics and automobiles are other industries where we've lost ground to countries that have greater local needs, lower costs or better management. In many cases, U.S. multinational companies have relocated plants abroad to cut costs.</br></br>Similarly, if competitiveness requires the United States to maintain its present share of the world economy, we are also probably doomed. We have recently maintained our share only because Europe and Japan have grown more slowly than the United States. But if China and India continue to grow rapidly, the U.S. share will shrink. The U.S. economy is now about $13 trillion; China's is about $2.2 trillion, says economist Nicholas Lardy of the Institute for International Economics. China's growth is 9 to 10 percent annually; the United States' is 3 to 4 percent. At those rates, China might pass the United States in 20 or 30 years, says Lardy. (However, per capita incomes in China would still be much lower.) The point: Global economic growth -- something the United States encourages -- erodes America's dominance. Technology, talent and wealth spread everywhere.</br></br>One possible ""competitiveness"" definition is the ability of countries to stay ahead in developing new industries. Economists once saw land, labor and capital as the basic inputs of any economy. But they've now added ""knowledge,"" as David Warsh -- former economics columnist for the Boston Globe -- shows in his engaging book ""Knowledge and the Wealth of Nations."" It doesn't just matter how much countries invest or how many people they employ. What also matters is how smartly. Can they create gadgets and services that people want or that solve important problems?"
"Asian markets were mixed early Friday as supportive comments from German Chancellor Angela Merkel helped sentiment.</br></br>Ms. Merkel said Germany is ""committed do everything we can in order to maintain the common currency."" Her comments were seen as supporting European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's vow to save the euro.</br></br>The euro was at $1.2355, stabilizing after climbing 0.6% overnight--the single currency's first climb in three sessions.</br></br>The yen was also in focus. It was at 79.27 to the dollar early Friday. The dollar strengthened against the Japanese currency overnight, at one point hitting a five-week high of Y79.40 as the positive sentiment weakened the desire to move into Asia's safe-haven currency and some investors became less confident that the U.S. Federal Reserve will launch another round of monetary stimulus.</br></br>The weaker yen remained a support for Japan's Nikkei, which was up 0.4% early Friday with steelmakers and brokerages leading the gains."
"WASHINGTON--U.S. regulators said Wells Fargo & Co. has convinced them that the financial system could avoid serious damage if the bank were to ever collapse, giving it a passing grade that ratchets up the pressure on other big banks slammed for producing unrealistic bankruptcy plans a few months ago.</br></br>The San Francisco-based lender graded better than its peers Tuesday on its plan for a theoretical bankruptcy, but it still doesn't have the top score regulators would like to see.</br></br>The bank declined to comment.</br></br>The Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said a hypothetical bankruptcy plan submitted by Wells Fargo ""provides a basis for a resolution strategy that could facilitate an orderly resolution under bankruptcy"" but said the blueprint still had some shortcomings that must be addressed when the bank files a revised plan in 2015. The agencies didn't specify the shortcomings. ""Resolution"" is shorthand for the process of unwinding a failing firm.</br></br>The results are the latest indication that regulators favor simplicity. Though it is one of the largest bank holding companies in the U.S. by assets, Wells Fargo has a simpler structure than other conglomerate financial firms. Compared to peers like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo has a relatively small broker-dealer business and a relatively small international footprint. Much of its operations take place in its FDIC-insured banking subsidiary."
"For almost 30 years, Morse - the father of truth-in-savings legislation - has been badgering Congress to force banks to tell you, straight, how much you're earning on savings accounts. All too often, you're getting substantially less than you think.</br></br>Morse's dream has finally came to pass. When President Bush signs the new banking bill, truth in savings will become the law of the land. Rep. Esteban Torres (D-Calif.) fought off all the last-minute attempts to bury the proposal.</br></br>""Usually, monsters rise up in the night to devour consumer legislation,"" says Edward Mierzwinski, a consumer advocate for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group in Washington and himself a persistent lobbyist for the law. ""This time the consumer won.""</br></br>Truth in savings won't take effect for at least 15 months, while the Federal Reserve writes regulations for it. During that process, Morse will stay on the lookout for monsters.</br></br>But the principle has been won.

Even before that date, the shiftier institutions will doubtlessly clean up their act."
"LONDON -- Eurodollar bond activity nearly ground to a halt on expectations that the January U.S. trade deficit to be released today widened more than initially forecast.</br></br>Meanwhile, more economic data were released that analysts said confirmed their belief that the U.S. economy will not slip into recession this year.</br></br>Amid bearish news for the dollar markets, new issues emerged in sterling, yen, and European currency units.

"Author: Brad Schiller</br></br>The latest employment reports have not been encouraging. At the rate of 36,000 new jobs a month--the number gained in January--we will never get back to full employment. Even if we keep adding jobs at the December rate of 121,000 new jobs, we wouldn't achieve full employment in this millennium.</br></br>President Obama has urged us to be ""patient"" with this jobless recovery. But it's worth asking how long it will take to get back to the employment levels we experienced before the recession of 2008-09. How patient will we need to be?</br></br>Consider the math of full employment. We now have a labor force of 153 million people, of whom 14 million are officially counted as ""unemployed,"" defined as not working and actively seeking a job. Were we fully employed (defined as 5% unemployment) there would be 7.7 million unemployed workers. So our ""excess"" unemployment currently hovers around 6.3 million workers.</br></br>That number is our initial target for job creation. The trouble is that it's a moving target."
"Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is a student of monetary history, so perhaps he remembers Sumner Slichter. In the 1950s, the Harvard economist made his reputation as the leader of an intellectual band that Time magazine dubbed the ""limited inflationists""--the idea that some inflation was good for an economy, and that the Fed should encourage a gradual rise in prices.</br></br>In a hearing on Capitol Hill, his views drew a famous rebuke from Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin, but Slichter's ideas gained currency in the 1950s and 1960s and eventually laid the groundwork for the not-so-gradual inflation of the 1970s.</br></br>Slichter died in 1959, but he is staging a rebirth at none other than Martin's former home, the Federal Reserve. A galaxy of Fed officials has fanned out to argue for another round of ""quantitative easing,"" or a further expansion of the Fed balance sheet to boost the economy. The ""limited inflationists"" are once again at America's monetary helm, promising happier days from rising prices while downplaying the costs and risks.</br></br>***</br></br>In the first QE go-around in spring 2009, financial panic was still in the air and the Fed's justification was to save us from Depression. Today, the panic is over and an economic recovery is underway. So the Fed's new justification is that growth is still too slow, unemployment is still too high and prices aren't rising fast enough."
"While the U.S. economy bounced back in the fourth quarter, Europe's own gross domestic product shrank for the first time since 1993, according to the chief European statistics agency. Still, evidence is mounting that a recovery on the Continent is under way.</br></br>Among the 12 countries that share the euro, GDP, the total value of goods and services, contracted by 0.2% in the fourth quarter from the third, Eurostat reported. Growth was dragged down by corporate retrenchment in the face of slackening global demand. But just as it followed the U.S. in its downturn, Europe appears to be moving upward now as well.</br></br>Surveys show that Europe's overall economic mood, as measured by the European Economic Sentiment Indicator, is now at its best since September, and inflation is on the whole falling. Spaniards are building. Italians are using more phone services and burning more electricity. The French keep buying. Lufthansa, the German airline, recently lifted a hiring freeze on cabin and ground crew as it prepares for more flights to the U.S. this summer. ""Indicators increasingly point to improvements in economic conditions,"" Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, said last week.</br></br>In its latest growth forecasts, the European Commission agreed. The European Union's executive body predicted yesterday that growth this quarter would be between 0.1% and 0.4%, from last quarter, and would improve further to 0.4% to 0.7% next quarter. ""These forecasts confirm that the slowdown is over but suggest that the recovery will be moderate,"" the commission said in a statement.</br></br>There is a wrinkle. The budding European economy is also unfolding at different rates in different countries. That isn't unusual for a large region, but part of the problem stems from the euro zone's very reason for being: Europe's common currency regime, which limits how much laggard countries such as Germany can spend to jump-start their economies."
"Anyone for Criterion Group shares?</br></br>Charles Miller, chairman of the big Houston money management firm, wants to cash in some chips. While he's a popular figure on the investment scene, even some of his peers don't want to be on the receiving end of the company's initial offering.</br></br>When the stock market looks healthy enough, Criterion plans to sell to the public 1.6 million common shares, about a 21% stake, for $21 to $24 apiece. Management will sell about one million of the shares -- an unusually high proportion of insider selling. At a $22.50-a-share offering price, the company would get $13 million of total proceeds of $36 million.</br></br>Mr. Miller will sell about 514,000 shares, cutting his stake to about 23%. He'll get about $11.5 million in cash, and his remaining holdings will be valued at about $38.5 million. But he won't be surrendering many votes to outside investors. Criterion has two classes of common shares, one carrying 20 times as many votes as the other. After the offering, Mr. Miller will have 86% of the votes.</br></br>The money manager may be selling at the right time. Since 1985, Criterion's revenue and profit have surged because of strong mutual fund sales. In the first half, its U.S. Government High Yield Trust alone accounted for 44% of revenue of $25.4 million. If interest rates rise, Criterion's customers could withdraw money, ""eroding commissions and fees,"" says Bob Natale, editor of Standard & Poor's new-issue newsletter."
"Surveying, with undisguised distaste from the mist-shrouded peaks of the New York Times op-ed page, the union hacks and Starbucks anarchists who sought to disrupt the Quebec trade summit last week, globalist-pundit Thomas L. Friedman sniffed: ""the anti-globalization movement is largely the well intentioned but ill informed being led around by the ill intentioned and well informed."" What the ignorant and malign anti-globalists do not understand, Friedman lectured, is that global trade expansion is ""the only route out of poverty for the world's poor"" -- not only a commercial good but a moral one too.</br></br>Friedman's assessment is important because he is as close as there is to the voice of the globalization establishment. The establishmentarian view, as it has evolved in the face of increasing criticism, is that globalization is great not only because it creates wealth in the developed countries but because it functions as a sort of super-missionary, spreading both wealth and freedom among the less blessed nations of the earth.</br></br>Last week in Quebec, George W. Bush summed up the perceived wisdom: ""We seek freedom not only for people living within our borders but also for commerce moving across our borders. Free and open trade creates new jobs and new income. It lifts the lives of all our people, applying the power of markets to the needs of the poor. . . . And open trade reinforces the habit of liberty.""</br></br>This argument is true as far as it goes. As Friedman's paper is currently reporting in a series on free trade, the blessings of unfettered commerce are a great deal less than munificent; but trade does bring jobs -- sweatshop jobs, gutter-level jobs, but still jobs - - to places where there were no jobs before. And, indeed, free trade has historically pulled freedom in its wake (although, as China is proving, this need not necessarily be so).</br></br>The problem with this argument is that it is a very fat herring of the reddest hue. It is beside the central political, economic and moral point of the whole debate. President Bush gave the game away in unscripted remarks on his proposal to create a hemispheric Free Trade Area of the Americas (at last, truly the world's largest shopping mall). Addressing demands that participating countries adhere to minimum standards of worker treatment and environmental protection, Bush said the agreement certainly must not contain ""codicils to destroy the spirit of free trade."" He added: ""While I understand that some unionists are interested in making sure there's labor protections, I don't want those labor protections to be used to destroy the free trade agreement."""
"The job market recovery continues, sort of, though what it gives with one hand it takes away with the other. In Friday's Labor Department report for November, the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 7.7% from 7.9% in October, but mainly because another 350,000 workers disappeared during the month.</br></br>Call it the case of the missing workers. In the last year, employers have added an average of about 150,000 workers a month. In November they added 146,000, less 49,000 in downward revisions for the previous two months. Hiring grew at a healthy pace in professional services, leisure and hospitality, while falling slightly in construction and manufacturing.</br></br>Yet even as payrolls are rising, albeit slowly, the overall labor participation rate has continued to fall. In November, the share of the available labor force that is working fell to 63.6%, which is down from 65.7% when the recession ended in June 2009.</br></br>Mull that one over: Three years into an economic expansion, the labor participation rate has fallen two full percentage points and three times this year (including November) it has reached the lowest level since 1981. This means that about three million more workers were working or looking for work in 2009 than in November. In the last year alone, the number of working age nonworkers grew to 89.2 million from 86.8 million.</br></br>So why are more Americans sitting on the labor market sidelines even as job opportunities expand? One popular suspect last month is Hurricane Sandy, yet the Bureau of Labor Statistics concluded that the storm ""did not substantially impact the national employment and unemployment estimates for November."""
"An article Thursday about a $20 million pay package approved Tuesday by the D.C. Council incorrectly reported that council member Betty Ann Kane (D-At large) is a lawyer. (Published 11/19/88)</br></br>D.C. Council Chairman David A. Clarke asked Congress yesterday to amend the city charter to prevent the 12 other council members from receiving automatic pay raises every time the salaries of the full-time chairman and the mayor's senior executives are raised.</br></br>The request, which Clarke said he forwarded to Congress after the council approved a motion by John Ray (D-At Large), came one day after the council acted on a $20 million D.C. government pay package that increased the annual salaries of council members to $69,500. Combined with a scheduled raise approved two years ago, the action will mean an increase of as much as $19,000 a year for some members.</br></br>Those increases-triggered in part by the link in the city charter between the salaries of Clarke and other council members-were criticized yesterday by some who fear the increases will exacerbate the District's worsening financial problems. The city has a projected budget deficit of $150 million. Although city officials said the $20 million cost of the pay package was included in the projected deficit, some council members at Tuesday's meeting questioned whether that was indeed the case.</br></br>""I believe that it is important for our council members and other executives to receive competitive compensation,"" said David Schlien, a vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents 6,000 D.C. employees. ""However, I am concerned that this is being implemented at a time when the city is facing a deficit."""

"Kudos to the Journal for getting it right in the article "","" page one, May 20).

However, they are doing anything but by targeting home and community-based services for persons with developmental disabilities.</br></br>Leaving aside the inhumanity of targeting such a vulnerable population, it is simply bad fiscal policy. Cutting these services results in adverse situations for the individuals, families and communities involved. When hours for personal-care attendants are cut to levels that no longer allow individuals to live in their own homes, one result is far costlier and undesirable nursing-home care. Additionally, direct-care workers lose jobs, further increasing state unemployment rates and, ironically, adding to Medicaid rolls.

"WASHINGTON -- New home sales shot up 7.1% in May, the Commerce Department reported, indicating that the housing market is gaining momentum again after slowing down the month before.</br></br>The Commerce Department said new homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 825,000 in May, nearly reversing the 8.1% decline in April.</br></br>Analysts have been astonished by home buyers' resilience. In its daily commentary about the economy, securities firm Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. told clients that the home-sales report indicates ""that the housing sector is strong, although it may have plateaued.""</br></br>For months now, analysts have been declaring that housing has hit its peak. Yet it keeps on thriving. Mortgage rates remain favorable, and consumers are definitely in good shape. ""What can you say?"" said economist Gary Ciminero of Independent Economic Advisory in Providence, R.I.

"For some money managers, the recent turbulence in the stock market isn't a reason to worry.

The Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 are all down for the year after advancing earlier in 2014, following a sharp reversal in once-hot corners of the market such as initial public offerings and the shares of young biotechnology and Internet companies.</br></br>The pullback underscores concern over the broader outlook for share prices following a 30% rise in the S&P 500 last year. Valuations remain above long-term averages, while U.S. growth and corporate earnings have hit a soft patch. That is exactly kind of environment that calls for a bumpier stock market, investors say.</br></br>""You don't want a market to go just straight up to the sky,"" says Lew Piantedosi, manager of the $142 million Eaton Vance Large-Cap Growth Fund, which has lost 5.5% over the past month but is up 19% over the past year.

"The highly profitable European unit that helped prop up General Motors Corp. during the recent U.S. recession suddenly doesn't look so invincible.</br></br>With some aging product lines in key segments and tougher competition in Germany, France and Italy, GM's European unit lost market share in the third quarter, slipping to 11.8% from 13.1%. During the first nine months of the year, GM Europe's sales volume grew, but trailed the market as a whole. Among GM's new problems in Europe, where it has led rivals in controlling costs, is a resurgency among Ford Motor Co., Volkswagen AG and Fiat SpA.</br></br>The setbacks in Europe, which GM maintains are only temporary, couldn't come at a worse time. As its third-quarter results indicate, GM is undergoing a long, slow turnaround in North America. Although the auto maker narrowed its loss in North America, it still was $296 in the red for each vehicle sold. By contrast, Chrysler Corp., which posted record earnings for the quarter, had a profit of $1,000 for each vehicle.</br></br>Investors continued to punish GM's stock Friday, a day after the company reported its disappointing third-quarter results. It fell $1.875 a share, or 4.4%, to close at $41.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</br></br>More analysts lowered their estimates for the next couple of quarters, saying GM's cost-cutting efforts may have plateaued. As a result, they said, it is unlikely that GM's debt ratings, which trail those of its domestic rivals, will be upgraded anytime soon."
"The nation's unemployment rate remained at 4.2 percent last month as job gains in construction, several service industries and government more than offset the loss of 94,000 manufacturing jobs, the Labor Department reported yesterday.</br></br>Analysts said details of the report indicated that many employers, other than factories, are reluctant to lay off workers, probably because they expect the current period of very slow economic growth to be short.</br></br>""To be sure, manufacturing is in recession, but the rest of the economy is alive and kicking,"" said economist Sung Won Sohn of Wells Fargo Bank. ""Even in autos, where two-thirds of the layoffs in manufacturing have occurred, 13,000 more jobs were created [last month].</br></br>""Adjusted for the volatility in weather, construction is in the process of stabilizing and gaining momentum,"" Sohn said. ""Services, which account for about 80 percent of jobs, are healthy. Health care, mortgage banking, retail, computer services and call centers have added jobs.""</br></br>Even with the loss of factory jobs, overall payrolls rose by 135,000 last month, more than expected after a gain of 224,000 in January. Those figures are up significantly from the 52,000 a month average in the fourth quarter of last year."

"The trouble with advertising is, frankly, that there isn't enough of it. Just in case you hadn't noticed, it's in a tailspin. Hey, this could be a catastrophe. Magazines and newspapers pay my bills. Advertising is their lifeblood (magazines get 50 percent of their revenues from ads, newspapers 80 percent). Is this the end of advertising? What about my future?</br></br>Almost everyone connected with advertising is in a funk. ""Ad Biz May Never Be the Same,"" says a headline in Advertising Age. ""Some veteran publishers are not shy about calling it {the ad decline} a depression,"" reports the industry newsletter MIN.</br></br>Here's why. In the first six months of 1991, ad revenues were down 14.4 percent at Newsweek, 18.5 percent at Business Week and 11 percent at TV Guide, reports the Publishers Information Bureau. Last week poor advertising caused Family Media Inc. to shut down its seven magazines, including Discover and Health.</br></br>Elsewhere in medialand, things aren't much better. Local and network TV ad revenues are off about 7 percent in 1991. Newspaper advertising was down in 1990 and also slipped 7 percent in the first quarter of 1991. Media company profits are being blitzed. The latest quarterly results are down 28 percent at Dow Jones & Co. compared with 1989, 87 percent at the New York Times Co. and 42 percent at The Washington Post Co.</br></br>Richard Harwood, ombudsman at The Post, speculates that a little adversity won't do the news business any harm. Maybe he's right. But how about a lot of adversity? Anyway, Harwood is near retirement, and he might feel differently if he worked at Family Media or for Psychology Today, New England Monthly, the National or California. They've all folded. In 1990, at least 20 magazines went belly up; the unofficial total so far in 1991 is 16, according to the Magazine Publishers of America. Some magazines are so desperate they're willing to slant stories to please advertisers, reports The Wall Street Journal. One health magazine reportedly offered to do a favorable story on two diet products for $25,000."

"WASHINGTON -- Hoping to lure private capital back to emerging markets, the World Bank plans to provide guarantees to help poor countries sell bonds to international investors.</br></br>The bank's board is expected on Tuesday to approve the new policy, which could last as long as two years. The partial guarantees, limited initially to a total of $2 billion, are intended to restore investor confidence in governments that adhere to sound economic policies but whose ability to borrow on international capital markets has been undermined by investor panic. That situation has been a common one during the financial upheaval of the past 20 months.</br></br>The guarantee program, which could also apply to commercial-bank loans, is one component of a broader international effort to prevent and resolve financial crises. The bank, the International Monetary Fund and the rich countries that fund them are trying to make as much progress as possible on those initiatives in time for the World Bank/IMF spring meetings, here at the end of the month.</br></br>A centerpiece of that effort is the search for ways to encourage private investors -- an increasing source of financing for developing countries during the 1990s -- to return to emerging-market bonds and to stay when things get shaky.</br></br>The World Bank and IMF are walking a fine line. They don't want to bail out private investors who already receive high yields on emerging-market bonds because the investors are taking big risks. But the institutions also want to be sure that deserving emerging-market governments have access to private capital even when markets are nervous. World Bank guarantees would make the bonds less risky; in exchange, investors presumably would accept lower interest rates."

"The dollar remains in heavy demand from banks around the world, a sign trust among banks remains fragile.</br></br>While a number of indicators show credit markets are thawing, economists, central bankers and investors are paying keen attention to the rate at which foreign banks are pulling dollar deposits out of their U.S. branches. That pace has set records for several months, according to the latest data from the Treasury Department. The moves, analysts say, suggest banks still are scrambling for ways to finance investments in dollar-denominated securities such as U.S. mortgage-backed bonds.</br></br>Before the credit crisis hit in August 2007, foreign banks could freely borrow dollars from U.S. banks and one another. Bank affiliates also could sell short-term IOUs. Now banks are demanding bigger lending premiums for certain loans.</br></br>On the bright side, the banks' increased reliance on U.S. deposits is making them less dependent on central-bank lending programs, which were put in place as an emergency backstop. Still, it also demonstrates how brittle the lending markets remain. Until banks develop more trust among one another, even short-term borrowing rates will remain relatively expensive, making economic recovery more costly for businesses and individuals.</br></br>This has had an unexpected effect on the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, which is supposed to reflect the interest rates banks charge each other for loans. A large gap has appeared between the one-month and three-month Libor, in what analysts say is a worrying sign that banks remain reluctant to make longer-term loans to one another. As of Friday, three-month dollar Libor was 1.01%, 0.59 percentage point more than the rate on one-month loans. Historically the gap hovered close to zero."

"So one week after The Deal, who are the winners and losers?</br></br>If the stock market is any guide, one obvious winner in the announced megamerger of America Online Inc. and Time Warner Inc. is Time Warner itself, which obtained a stunning 70% merger premium to its then-prevailing stock price. The transaction was valued at about $160 billion when announced, but the decline in AOL's stock reduced the value to a current price of $138 billion.</br></br>In some respects, that was completely expected, and the one-day delay before AOL's decline -- now standing at about 18% -- was largely driven by the early euphoria over the deal. But what also took place was a massive transfer of value from AOL shareholders to Time Warner shareholders, so a decline in AOL was inevitable, points out one media investment banker. Time Warner's shares ended up 25% for the week, a very respectable showing.</br></br>Though it was precedent-setting in many respects, from a financial point of view the transaction was a typical late '90s deal: a fast-growing upstart with a high-multiple stock -- WorldCom Inc., Qwest Communications International Inc., Global Crossing Ltd. -- using its currency to buy a more-established company with hard assets. Thus, WorldCom acquired MCI Communications to form MCI WorldCom Inc. (and is now buying Sprint Corp.), Qwest is acquiring U S West Inc., and Global Crossing acquired Frontier Corp. Those deals all deflated the multiples of the buyers.</br></br>Then, later in the week Charles Schwab Corp., the online brokerage behemoth that has an Internet-like multiple compared with other financials, said it would pay $2.7 billion in stock to buy blue-blooded U.S. Trust Corp. The two seemingly dissimilar announcements underscored to Wall Street that the new and old worlds combining would likely be good news for the old-world stocks -- and for more mergers. Trust banks climbed on the news."
"Is there any truth to the image of telecommuters as pajama-clad, unshaven workers who get easily distracted by child care, personal telephone calls or housework?</br></br>Probably not, according to AT&T Corp., which tracked its employees' telework patterns for the past 10 years. In fact, the company's surveys show that its teleworkers are more productive than those who work in an office.</br></br>Most large companies today have at least a few people who telecommute from home, if not on a daily basis, then with some sort of regularity. With longer commutes, child-care issues, a global economy and, of course, much better technology, it only makes sense to allow workers to work from home at times.</br></br>About 90 percent of AT&T's management employees work from home at least some of the time, while 30 percent of them work completely from home. Other workers have the ability to spend days at home on an as-needed basis.</br></br>But with our new world of widespread telecommuters come growing pains. Telecommuting mistakes can cost companies money, productivity and employee morale, according to AT&T. Its own ""casual"" study of worst practices (that's such a nice change from all the best- practices research out there) found that companies don't trust employees to be productive, said Cathy Martine, senior vice president of Internet telephony at AT&T. Companies also face problems in that teleworkers miss face-to-face contact. But those companies that don't permit teleworking fall flat during weather or other disasters, when employees could have worked from home, even if they could not travel to the office."

Nevertheless, he said ""we look forward to working with Mr. Fox on the major issues of the relationship, especially immigration and economic issues.""</br></br>A top adviser to Mr. Fox says Mexico also should endorse a recent AFL-CIO initiative to grant an amnesty to illegal immigrants living in the U.S. An estimated eight million Mexicans live in the U.S., with about half believed to have entered without documents. While many are able to legalize their status through marriage or other means, the number of undocumented arrivals is growing faster than ever -- about 300,000 this year.</br></br>In comparison, the number of Mexicans entering with visas is small, about 70,000 a year, according to the adviser.

"Wholesale prices soared last month, fed mostly by a sharp increase in grain prices but also by a rise in fuel costs, the Department of Labor reported yesterday.</br></br>The 1.2 per cent increase in wholesale prices, which are a precursor of what consumers eventually pay, further feeds worries that inflation, which had slowed substantially during the recession, might be rekindled during the early stages of the recovery.</br></br>The wholesale price index jumped 1.2 per cent in July, mainly' because of a 6.6 per cent increase in the price of farm products and a 3.3 per cent rise in processed foods and feeds. Industrial prices rose 0.4 per cent for the second month in a row.</br></br>The farm price rise was triggered by rumors of another large purchase of grain by the Soviet Union, which bought 19 million tons from the United States in 1972 and sent the price of wheat and other grains soaring.</br></br>Last month grain prices rose 10.7 per cent. A Labor Department analyst said most of the grain price rise occurred before the July 16 announcement that the Soviet Union would purchase 9.8 million tons of wheat and corn."

"The Treasury Department said Wednesday that the federal deficit for April soared to $82.7 billion, the largest imbalance for that month on record. That was significantly higher than last year's April deficit of $20 billion and above the $30 billion deficit that private-sector economists had expected.</br></br>The government generally runs surpluses in April, as millions of taxpayers file their income tax returns. But income tax payments were down this April, reflecting the impact of the recession, which has pushed millions of people out of work.</br></br>The Obama administration forecast in February that the deficit for this year would hit $1.56 trillion, surpassing the record of $1.4 trillion set last year. Many private-sector economists think that this year's imbalance will be closer to the $1.4 trillion set last year and that deficits will remain high for years to come.</br></br>The trillion-dollar-plus deficits are being driven by the effects of the recession, which has cut government tax revenue while driving up spending.</br></br>Analysts estimate that roughly one-third of the increase in deficits over the past two years can be attributed to lost revenue -- the result of fewer people working and lower corporate profits. Another third was from increased government spending that normally occurs in a downturn, such as higher payments for unemployment benefits and food stamps. The final third reflects added government spending on the $787 billion stimulus bill and the $700 billion financial bailout."
"WASHINGTON -- Rising energy costs pushed U.S. consumer prices higher last month, though the increase was partly offset by tame prices for housing and discretionary-spending items.</br></br>The data should provide some comfort to Federal Reserve officials that high oil and commodity prices and the weak dollar aren't leading to higher underlying inflation.</br></br>The consumer-price index rose 0.3% in October, the Labor Department said, matching September's increase. The so-called core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, advanced 0.2% for a fifth straight month. Unrounded, core CPI increased 0.159%.</br></br>In a separate report, the Labor Department said the average weekly earnings of U.S. workers, adjusted for inflation, fell 0.2% in October, as wages failed to keep up with inflation.</br></br>Consumer prices in October were up 3.5% from a year earlier. Core CPI was up 2.2%. The gap between the two inflation measures could widen as higher energy prices keep pushing up overall inflation while softness in housing and auto prices keep underlying inflation in check."
"The latest idea to help cash-strapped state governments and resuscitate the U.S. economy: Revive former President Richard Nixon's plan for sharing federal revenues with the states.</br></br>Alice Rivlin, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former Clinton administration budget director, floated the idea this week, with a twist. From 1972 to 1980, the federal government sent unrestricted cash to the states regardless of the economic climate. Ms. Rivlin proposes creating a trigger to automatically start the payments when the economy enters a recession. This way, the federal government could come to the aid of states, helping them avoid poorly timed tax increases and social-service spending cuts.</br></br>But Mr. Nixon's fellow Republicans long ago disowned his idea, and Congress is unlikely to embrace it. Indeed, for nearly a year, states have lobbied Congress for aid only to come away empty-handed. There was bipartisan support in the Senate for a plan to temporarily raise the federal share of funding for Medicaid, a health plan for low-income and disabled people jointly paid for by the states and federal government. The idea has slowly died in the Republican-controlled House. More recently, states have failed so far to get an agreement to increase funding for cash assistance and welfare-to-work programs.</br></br>Why can't the states get any help from Washington? A majority in Congress, mainly Republicans, don't want to approve new spending because of the growing federal deficit -- exactly what killed general revenue sharing 20 years ago. They would rather approve spending for which they can take credit.</br></br>Some argue that states helped to create their own crisis by unrealistically relying on uninterrupted tax revenue fattened by '90s personal income-tax and other gains while also enacting spending programs and reducing taxes."
"Author: Matt Whittaker</br></br>NEW YORK--Silver prices soared toward $50 an ounce, though they pulled back sharply toward the end of the day, sparking some speculation that the metal's stunning three-month rally may be nearing an end.</br></br>At one point during the day, silver futures were up 8.2% at $49.82 an ounce. They closed at $47.1510, still the highest in 31 years. Prices have jumped 52% this year, and the intraday high exceeded the nominal closing record of $48.70 set back in 1980. The failure to reach $50 an ounce is one sign that the rally may be losing steam.</br></br>""The way we've come off, there's a possibility we've seen a high for the near term,"" said Frank Lesh, a broker and futures analyst with FuturePath Trading.</br></br>Silver is riding on the coattails of gold, as investors have flocked to precious metals due to their safe-haven status amid a weakening dollar.

"Although many Americans are joyfully anticipating your inauguration, I see no reason to celebrate yet. In one sense, I'm glad you won. Unlike many of my generation, who bemoan the uselessness or corruption of the political process, I rejected the easy pessimism of not voting and cast a ballot for you.</br></br>Your campaign, however, placed me and most other blacks in a painful predicament. By claiming you were running against the ""special interests"" (blacks, labor and feminists) that have supposedly kept the Democrats out of the White House for the last 12 years, you skillfully undermined honest debate about racial justice. And by dissing Sista Souljah and distancing Jesse Jackson at a single stroke, you confirmed the bitter belief among many of us that even well-intentioned whites are unable to play the game of racial politics above board.</br></br>Here's our dilemma: If we speak up, we're special interest whiners, but if we keep quiet, we lose self-respect and reinforce our own invisibility. I, for one, cannot remain silent. Your actions were, in my view, calculating and unprincipled, and they angered me - but not enough to make me believe that you could not redeem yourself.</br></br>Although I hold a degree in economics, I am a radical rapper by profession, an artist whose outrage pushed me to write and record ""Bush Killa,"" which appears on my album, ""Sleeping With the Enemy."" The song has sparked controversy because it imagines the stalking and slaying of the president, that ready-made symbol of politics and policies that have assaulted black America for nearly half my life. I understood that the language in this violent fantasy would be disturbing to many, but what I hoped to call attention to - the real- life economic violence visited upon millions of African-American people every day of their lives - is more disturbing and more real.</br></br>I am, nonetheless, at least slightly hopeful about what you can achieve with your presidential power. I like your rhetoric about putting people first, and I can't see you being worse than your predecessor."
"Uncle Sam Has an Inflation Deal for You</br></br>Talk about money for nothing.</br></br>Late last month, the U.S. Treasury issued debt at a record-low yield to maturity of negative 1.286% over nearly five years. Of course, there was a catch: The government also is obligated to compensate the holder of the instrument, a Treasury inflation-protected security, for any change in the consumer-price index between now and when it matures.</br></br>The buyers of the TIPS were betting on inflation of at least 2% to earn the break-even return -- the amount that would at least equal the 0.71% they could have received on an ordinary five-year Treasury the same day. That is well above the 1.4% year-on-year gain in the consumer-price index reported for July, or the 1.5% gain for August expected on Friday.</br></br>And the amount that investors have been willing to pay has risen noticeably. Ever since talk heated up that the Federal Reserve will engage in a third round of bond buying, implied bets on inflation have, too. The 10-year break-even rate has risen to 2.376% currently from 2% in late July."
"THE ADMINISTRATION i9 turning up the volume of its campaign against the Federal Reserve Board. The accusation is that the Federal Reserve is deliberately holding the money supply excessively low and driving up interest rates. The further implication, increasingly audible, is that it‰Ûªs being done as an attack on President Reagan, to interfere with his reelection campaign.</br></br>The charge is false, and the implication is disgraceful. There‰Ûªs another explanation for the rise in interest , rates‰ÛÓless conspiratorial but a good deal more accurate.</br></br>From the beginning there has been a strongly inflationary component in the Reagan economic plan. The administration has never acknowledged it. But the administration‰Ûªs emphasis on tax cuts and high spending‰ÛÓfederal spending under Mr. Reagan has reached the highest levels since World War II‰ÛÓconstitutes a sure formula for fast and grossly inflationary expansion of the economy. The past recession brought the inflation rate down and until recently veiled the consequences of this plan. But with the recovery now in its second year, the symptoms are becoming unmistakable.</br></br>Interest rates are rising because a great borrowing boom has begun. The federal government is borrowing extremely heavily to cover its budget deficits, and now business and consumer borrowing are ac- celerating rapidly as well. The effects on interest are compounded by a rising fear of inflation ahead.</br></br>The administration says that it wants the Federal Reserve to supply only enough money to the banking system to permit ‰ÛÏnon-inflationary growth‰Û of the economy. But how much growth is that? In the first three months of this year, file growth rate was 8.3 percent a year. True non-inflationary growth is less than half that rate. But the secretary of file Treasury, Donald Regan, launched an unusually explicit attack on the Federal Reserve yesterday with the assertion that no signs of rising inflation are visible."
"After 12 years as a real estate broker, Marilyn Korman was ready for a career change. Business had slowed and the heady days of fat commissions were in the past. So the New York woman landed a job as a loan-production officer at the Dime Savings Bank in October.</br></br>Six months later Korman was laid off by the bank, becoming a statistic of hard times in the mortgage-banking industry brought on by a slowdown in home sales.</br></br>""We knew that real estate was bad, so we knew volume in banking wouldn't be good,"" she said. ""I thought that better times would be ahead of us.""</br></br>Some mortgage bankers say the industry is facing a crisis. Others say it is going through a natural cycle.</br></br>What is clear is that the rapid expansion that took place during the boom years of the mid-1980s has all but stopped in its tracks. In its place are consolidations and layoffs as mortgage bankers and brokers hunker down for lean times."

"Retail sales rose 0.8 percent in August and prices at the wholesale level jumped 0.3 percent, but neither report was enough to support Wall Street‰Ûªs fears of a return to raging inflation or an economy heating up, economists said yesterday.</br></br>Many analysts said there is little evidence to suggest that the economy will continue on anything but a sluggish track, including the latest government statistics released yesterday.

However, the increase in August was all attributed to brisk auto sales. Sales were up 0.3 percent in July."
"NEW YORK -- This is a recovery that may need all the help it can muster. The economy as a whole has been expanding for a year, but mostly at a snail's pace and far more slowly than is normal in the early stages of a business-cycle upswing. The unemployment rate hangs stubbornly above 7%, higher than when the recovery began. And new-home starts, a rare bright spot during most of 1991 and early this year, fell sharply in April.</br></br>Help is clearly needed, but is any on the way? Perhaps. A likely source, as important as it is unexciting: capital spending.</br></br>Such outlays, typically for new plant and equipment, tend to lag behind the economy as a whole. The Commerce Department, in fact, classifies plant-and-equipment spending, adjusted for inflation, as a lagging economic indicator at points in the business cycle when, as now, the economy is emerging from a slump. Such spending invariably fell, for example, in the early months of four other recoveries since 1969.</br></br>This pattern has occurred again in the current recovery. In last year's second quarter, as the recovery was just beginning to take hold, plant-and-equipment spending fell to an annual rate of some $487 billion, in terms of the 1987 dollar's buying power; this was $9 billion less than in the previous quarter. But more recently an impressive climb has taken place: The spending level recently moved above $525 billion.</br></br>Further substantial increases seem probable. Most forecasters look for the recovery to persist and broaden in coming months. In the process, businesses will need to expand their facilities appreciably. Indeed, the task could become urgent if the recovery should prove unexpectedly brisk. After much restructuring and many plant closings, manufacturers already are using nearly 80% of their capacity."

"NEW YORK -- Expect rising interest rates this spring as the economy expands at a brisk pace.</br></br>That's the message from a growing number of economists and investment managers amid concern about rapid money-supply growth recently. Some predict the Federal Reserve System will tighten its credit grip within the next few months in an effort to restrain the money supply and remind investors of its determination to combat inflation.</br></br>Strong economic growth will encourage businesses and consumers to increase their borrowing, adding to pressures for higher rates, analysts say. ""I expect rates to move up over the next few months because demands for credit will increase as the economy strengthens and because the Fed probably will find it necessary to become more restrictive,"" says Leif H. Olsen, who heads Citicorp Information Services, a unit of Citicorp.</br></br>This view attracted more supporters last week after Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, outlined the central bank's money-supply and economic forecasts at a Senate Banking Committee session. Although Mr. Volcker didn't make any forecasts about interest rates or Fed credit policy, many Fed-watchers interpreted his remarks to mean that the board eventually will adopt a tougher credit policy. Other Fed officials have declined to elaborate. Mr. Volcker is scheduled to testify again tomorrow at a House Banking subcommittee hearing.</br></br>""Market jitters about the Fed's intentions are likely to contribute to further near-term increases in both short- and long-term interest rates,"" said Henry Kaufman, chief economist of Salomon Brothers Inc. In the latest issue of his weekly publication, ""Comments on Credit,"" Mr. Kaufman predicts that the federal funds rate ""will drift up toward 9% before the end of March."" The funds rate, which is the rate on reserves that banks lend one another overnight, has been hovering around 8 1/2% recently."
"After three years of snapping up bargains, the folks who do the buying for U.S. businesses are discovering that they must pay higher prices.</br></br>""The pricing initiative is going to the producer from the purchaser,"" says Douglas R. Cliggott, a senior economist with Merrill Lynch Economics, a unit of the brokerage concern.</br></br>For two years, balky buyers beat back most attempts to raise prices, but now many of the increases are sticking. The sudden change has affected major industrial products from plastics and paper goods to chemicals and components.</br></br>Eventually, the higher prices will be passed on to consumers. They aren't likely to lead to double-digit inflation any time soon, though. For the most part, the wholesale price increases have been selective and moderate, and they are fragile because of the world-wide surplus of many materials. Still, leading economists agree that consumer prices, paced by higher energy and imported-goods prices, will probably climb 3.3% this year, compared with last year's 1.9% increase, and will probably rise an additional 4.2% in 1988.</br></br>The price upswing reflects several factors. Some industries have added little new capacity in the past three years because of the prolonged price weakness, and mergers and restructurings have resulted in some scrapped capacity. By midyear, for instance, only 28 U.S. plants, or almost half the number a decade ago, will make car tires."
"The budget ax unsheathed last week by Prince George's County Executive Wayne K. Curry cuts deeply into the criminal justice system, leaving law enforcement officials unable to do many of the things they once could, according to prosecutors, judges and police.</br></br>Curry's efforts to close a 1996 budget deficit of more than $100 million would cut the Circuit Court's $7.3 million budget by nearly $1 million and the state's attorney's $5.4 budget by about $800,000. The county's chief administrative judge and top prosecutor both say that the cuts will leave the courthouse unable to provide Prince George's citizenry with a full range of services.</br></br>""There's absolutely no way I can operate the office on this proposed budget,"" said State's Attorney Jack B. Johnson.</br></br>Johnson said that Curry's spending plan would require him to cut about 30 of the office's 120 employees, including lawyers, investigators and secretaries. At 90 employees -- 45 of them prosecutors -- the state's attorney's office would be smaller than it was a decade ago.</br></br>""The number of homicides in this county have tripled since then, and I haven't even begun to talk about attempted murder, sex abuse cases and assaults,"" Johnson said. ""I have 50 attorneys right now and I just can't go any lower than that."""
"ASIA'S CURRENCIES have stabilized, and stock markets are bouncing back. The U.S. economy continues to roll, with 358,000 jobs created last month as wages rise, unemployment remains low and the Dow Jones average forges ahead. Maybe, a member of Congress might think, the Asian financial storm has blown past. Maybe we don't have to give the International Monetary Fund all those billions the Clinton administration is pressing for.</br></br>If only it were so. Unfortunately, on many levels, it is too soon to relax. For millions of workers and their families in Indonesia, Thailand, South Korea and elsewhere, trouble is just beginning. Even if their nations' currencies and stock markets have bottomed out, the consequences of rising unemployment, slowed economic growth and declining standards of living have yet to unfold. To some extent, such consequences are unavoidable. But Americans have more than a humanitarian interest in mitigating Asia's pain.</br></br>So far, the economic impact on the United States has been, if anything, beneficial, as Asia's crisis dampens inflationary pressure here. But in the coming months the impact is likely to be less positive, as competitive pressures threaten some American jobs. And if the economic crisis worsens and provokes ethnic riots in Indonesia and social instability elsewhere, the national security and economic impact on the United States could be adverse in the extreme.</br></br>Moreover, the financial situation remains precarious. This is especially so in Indonesia, where the dictatorial President Suharto refuses to recognize the need for more democracy or to prepare the ground for a political transition. Democratic South Korea is in far better shape, thanks to the earnestness and skill with which President-elect Kim Dae Jung has devoted himself to far-reaching economic reform. But even South Korea remains vulnerable to shifts in fickle and sometimes irrational international financial flows. So do nations not yet infected, or barely infected, by the Asian ""contagion,"" from China to Hong Kong to Russia to Brazil. Any one of these developing nations, or all of them, could be tripped up by a congressional refusal to support the IMF.</br></br>Critics attack the IMF, the international organization leading the financial rescues of Asia's economies, on two grounds. Some accept its importance but cite the mistakes it has made. It has made mistakes, and it does need to be more open in its functioning. But the reforms it's promoting this time around -- for less corruption and cronyism, greater openness, reliable unemployment insurance and more -- will promote democracy and social welfare if faithfully implemented."
"More Travelers</br></br>Hitting the Road</br></br>AMERICANS ARE TAKING to the family car for vacation this summer, and road-trip specialists are in hot pursuit.</br></br>Eighty percent of vacationers will travel by car this year, up 4% from 1993, according to the American Automobile Association. By contrast, 16% will go by airplane, and 3% by bus and train. The price of an auto vacation has run well behind the pace of inflation over the past 10 years, says Graeme R. Clarke, an AAA vice president. ""It continues to be a fantastic bargain.""</br></br>Small businesses are hoping to take advantage of the boom. In Darien, Ill., 52-year-old Ken Reinhart has started a one-man company, called 48 States by Car, which creates a personalized itinerary for road trips -- with hotel reservations, restaurant recommendations and a list of radio stations along the way. The itinerary, which costs $70, takes about three weeks to develop and comes with travel brochures. ""I'll give you recommendations for everything,"" says Mr. Reinhart, a retired physical education teacher. ""I really try to make the vacation mine."""
"A problem involving rents paid for apartments and houses caused the government to slightly understate the rate of consumer price inflation for the first eight months of the year, officials said yesterday.</br></br>The Bureau of Labor Statistics yesterday revised its monthly figures for the consumer price index to correct the problem, raising the inflation rate by 0.1 percentage point, to 3.5 percent on an annual basis, for the January through August period. The rate for the so-called core portion of the index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was also lifted by the same amount, to 2.7 percent.</br></br>Katharine G. Abraham, commissioner of labor statistics, said at a press briefing the problem first arose in January 1999 when the agency began using a significantly different sample of housing units to collect rent information. However, she said, the CPI figures for 1999 were not revised because the agency decided the changes were too small to warrant all the problems such a revision would cause for everyone who uses the CPI to adjust benefits, pay, rents and even parts of the tax code for inflation.</br></br>""It would be enormously disruptive for the whole gamut of users of this information"" if the 1999 figures had been revised, Abraham said, adding that her agency's guidelines for such matters say ""we should not be revising too far back in time.""</br></br>The agency will not know until next month, when it has the September price figures, whether the changes announced yesterday will affect next year's cost-of-living increases in Social Security payments, veterans' benefits and federal pensions. Those benefits are raised each January according to the increase in the average level of the CPI in the July through September period from the level in the same three months of the preceding year."
"Economic indicators released Friday confirmed what tight-fisted American consumers have already concluded: The economy may be recovering, but barely.</br></br>Retail sales grew 0.4 percent in July after falling a revised 0.3 percent in June, the Commerce Department reported. The increase was the first one in three months and was mainly attributable to a rebound in auto sales boosted by dealer incentives. Department store sales declined 1 percent, and sales at clothing stores fell 0.7 percent. Despite the slight gain, sales failed to meet expectations.</br></br>Business inventories, a key piece of data that economists use to judge the growth of the wider economy, rose for the sixth consecutive month in June to 0.3 percent. Sales at the wholesale level fell for the second month in a row, although the 0.6 percent decline was significantly less than the 1.2 percent drop in May.</br></br>Consumer sentiment is similarly lukewarm. An index of what they think about the economy by Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan rose to 69.6 in early August from 67.8 in July, which had been the lowest level since November, Reuters reported. Despite the small increase, consumers did not anticipate an improved economy any time soon.</br></br>Consumer inflation edged up for the first time in four months and slightly above forecasts to 0.3 percent in July, adjusted for seasonal variations, according to the Labor Department. The gain was mainly due to an increase in energy costs. Overall inflation, excluding the volatile statistics for energy and food, rose only 0.1 percent."
"Since the 1980s, the key question about the U.S. budget deficit has been not whether it would be reduced but whether this would be accomplished by spending reductions or tax increases. Similarly, today the question about entitlements is not whether Medicare or Social Security will be fixed but whether these repairs will involve reduced benefits and enhanced efficiency or will instead entail more taxes. In general, the success and permanence of fiscal adjustments depend on their form, especially on whether governments restrain the growth of outlays.</br></br>The idea that the form of a fiscal adjustment matters more than the amount is the theme of a recent International Monetary Fund study by Alberto Alesina and Roberto Perotti, ""Fiscal Adjustment in OECD Countries: Composition and Macroeconomic Effects."" The authors examined the experience with budget-deficit reduction in 20 major developed countries in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development from 1960 to 1994.</br></br>In 62 of the 378 annual observations the study considered, the government was conducting a fiscal adjustment, defined as a reduction in the cyclically adjusted budget deficit by at least 1.5% of GDP. However, only about one-quarter of these adjustments were successful three years later -- successful meaning that the fall in the fiscal deficit was sustained or that the cumulated reduction in the ratio of the public debt to GDP was at least five percentage points. Examples of successes were Ireland and Sweden in the late 1980s and Denmark in the mid-1980s. The United States made the success list only for 1976.</br></br>The interesting finding in the Alesina-Perotti study is that a plan's success or failure depends on the composition of the reform. For one thing, the successful cases concentrated much more on spending reductions than on revenue increases. In the successes, 73% of the deficit reduction involved spending less, whereas for the failures, only 44% took this form.</br></br>The composition of the spending cuts also differed markedly. In the successes, 51% of the spending decreases were in transfers and government wages, while 20% was in public investment. For the failures, only 17% of the reduced spending was on transfers and government wages, whereas a striking 63% was in public investment. Referring to the successful reform model as type 1, the authors write, ""The reason why type 1 adjustments were successful is that they tackle the two items of the budget, government wages and welfare programs, which have the strongest tendency to automatically increase."" In contrast, in the typical unsuccessful effort, described as type 2, the focus on cuts in public investment reveals a short-term outlook with no lasting commitment to fiscal discipline."

"Seven weeks after Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz called early elections on the strength of his government's economic track record, Turkey is trying to weather the fallout from the economic collapse in Russia, its principal trading partner.</br></br>Until this summer, Turkish officials had been predicting that the country would escape the economic contagion spreading from Southeast Asia. As of mid-year, the economy had enjoyed three years of steady growth, and Yilmaz's anti-inflation policies had won the approval of the International Monetary Fund and brought foreign investors flocking.</br></br>But Russia's festering economic problems already had begun to erode Turkey's strong base, and the recent Russian financial collapse and the free fall of the ruble have sent shock waves southward.</br></br>According to recently released government figures, Turkey's official trade with Russia declined 15 percent in the first half of this year. The unofficial export of textiles and other goods to Russia and other former Soviet Bloc countries, which earned the Turks around $8.5 billion in foreign exchange two years ago, is expected to bring in little more than $4 billion in 1998.</br></br>Overall, Turkey has seen its trade deficit grow to $7.5 billion in the first half of this year. In addition, internal commerce is undergoing a cyclical slowdown, analysts say. Concerns have gradually spread among investors, who looked to Yilmaz to implement policies that might halt the economic slide."

Kennedy's administration. He was a major contributor to theories of investment, consumption, money and banking and economic growth, and he was widely known in academia and business as a leading apostle of the economic thinking of British economist John Maynard Keynes: that tax and budget policies can be used effectively to regulate an economy.</br></br>As a Keynesian economist, Dr. Tobin feuded with monetarists who argue that controlling the supply of money and credit is the best way to regulate an economy. His sharp attacks on Milton Friedman, the winner of the 1976 Nobel Prize in economics and widely recognized as the dean of monetarists, were particularly well publicized, as were his criticisms in the early 1980s of Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul A. Volcker. Volcker's ""single-minded"" effort to curb inflation with tough monetary policy, Dr. Tobin told a congressional subcommittee, was likely to result in damage ""to the real economy in terms of unemployment, low production, recession, low investment and so on.""</br></br>Economics, Dr. Tobin once told a meeting of the American Economic Association, ""inevitably blends ideology and science.""</br></br>Describing the portfolio selection theory that helped him win a Nobel Prize, he said it ""sets forth the principle of not putting all your eggs in one basket because then, if something goes wrong, you lose them all at once.""

Hobart Rowen, the late Washington Post business editor, wrote that ""Tobin's work for the first time showed the relationship of financial assets to the development of government financial policy."""
"NEW YORK -- A portrait of the art market after this week would probably contain a greater share of somber hues.</br></br>Art dealers and art collectors across the country say the wild swings in the stock market may damp some of the euphoria that has characterized the art market in recent years. A number of dealers report that buyers who had paintings on hold or who had planned to purchase paintings are calling to postpone or cancel the deals. And some art experts expect the stratospheric prices that some works have commanded will return to more realistic levels -- just as the important fall auction season is beginning.</br></br>""I think the speculative fever (in art-buying) will subside now,"" says Lewis Manilow, a Chicago real-estate investor and major art collector. ""This (stock market crash) is a dash of realism, and the art world needs some realism, too. It can't be endless.""</br></br>Adds W. Graham Arader III, a print dealer who owns galleries in seven cities: ""The art boom is over. It just got too high and it's over."" Mr. Arader says he did a brisk business in August, especially to ""Forbes 400 people,"" but that even before the crash, less-affluent collectors had stopped buying. ""We did seven antique shows in the past three weeks, and we couldn't sell a thing,"" he says. ""That has me scared.""</br></br>No one expects the art market to collapse in a heap: There is no Dow Jones average that lumps together Louis XIV furniture and Picasso paintings. ""Blue chip"" art works have historically held their value much better than lower quality pieces in a downturn, and the Van Gogh iris painting set for sale at Sotheby's on Nov. 11 is still expected to fetch about $30 million, the second-highest price ever for a painting. Sotheby's is the auction house unit of London-based Sotheby's Holdings Inc."
"WASHINGTON -- For months, market-watchers and analysts have been on the lookout for any sign that inflation -- largely dormant for years -- may be stirring.</br></br>But the latest gauge, the Labor Department's February producer-price index, which measures prices paid to the nation's farms, factories and refineries, proved inconclusive.</br></br>Inflation hawks could cite the index's larger-than-expected 1% increase, the largest monthly advance since October 1990, as evidence that a broader resurgence may be on the horizon. As in previous months, much of that increase stems from a sharp run-up in the cost of energy goods, which soared 7.5%, the biggest gain in almost a decade. Wholesale prices overall were 4% higher than they were in February 1999, the largest year-over-year change in more than 13 months.</br></br>On the other hand, the report offers some reason for optimism. Excluding food and energy, prices rose 0.3% for the month, with a 6.3% surge in cigarette prices accounting for all of that increase. For the past 12 months, prices for core finished goods climbed just 1%, the lowest year-over-year change since last November.</br></br>Investors seemed undisturbed by yesterday's inflation report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 499.19 points -- a record rise when measured by points gained -- to close at 10630.60 as investors poured cash into blue-chip stocks. Bonds, which tend to fall in price on any sign of inflation, actually rose yesterday. The 10-year Treasury bond rose 10/32 point, about $3.125 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The issue's yield eased to 6.238%."

"For homeowners, these are the best of times. The economy has been expanding for 27 consecutive quarters. Over the past year, the stock market peaked and consumer confidence reached its highest level in 28 years. Mortgage interest and unemployment rates are the lowest they have been in decades.

Even crime rates are down.</br></br>So it is only natural that home sales are breaking records and prices are beating inflation.</br></br>That's the conclusion of the latest Home Price Forecast, prepared for The Wall Street Journal by the economic research firm Case Shiller Weiss Inc. of Cambridge, Mass.

In Chicago, where the economists predict the lowest price rises of the 10 metro areas, home prices are just keeping pace with inflation and houses are languishing on the market. ""I've lowered my price $10,000, and there still have been no offers,"" says retired publisher Frank Albergo, whose 2,000-square-foot, turreted Norman-style home has been on the market for more than a year. It is currently listed at $239,000.</br></br>San Francisco, by contrast, is expected to remain the country's hottest and the most expensive housing market. Susan Sparks, a researcher at the University of California at Berkeley, expects a quick sale of her 2,046-square-foot tract home, recently listed for $205,000. She says 15 homes in her development have sold in the past six months, some ""for their full listing price in two weeks or less."""
"China's inflation remained tepid in January, but economists said the country's central bank still has little room to ease monetary policy as concerns over growing debt overshadow slowing economic growth.</br></br>China's consumer-price index rose 2.5% year-over-year, data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Friday showed, matching December's pace. Economists had expected a slightly lower figure, but on Friday said January's figure was still mild.</br></br>China's CPI typically spikes around the Lunar New Year holiday, which fell at the end of January, but this year muted food prices helped to keep overall inflation modest. A stronger Chinese yuan has also helped push down the prices of imported goods, said Bill Adams, an economist at U.S.-based PNC Financial Services.</br></br>Consumer inflation could pick up somewhat later this year, averaging 3% in 2014, according to estimates by J.P. Morgan. Still, that would be easily within the government's stated tolerance of 3.5%.</br></br>Despite a slowing economy and tepid price rises, the central bank is unlikely to cut interest rates or tone down its commitment to slowing the growth of credit, experts said."

"Limited Inc., reversing a seven-year-old decision to separate Intimate Brands Inc., said it is offering nearly $1.5 billion in stock to buy back the 16% it doesn't already own in the company.</br></br>Limited, based in Columbus, Ohio, offered part of Intimate Brands, parent of Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works, to the public in 1995 in a move designed to highlight the value of the businesses. At the time, Intimate Brands accounted for 70% of Limited's operating income but less than 60% of the company's stock-market valuation. Today, the two measures are more in line. Limited gets more than 90% of its operating income from Intimate Brands and about 95% of its market capitalization.</br></br>""The most significant factor in the Board's decision to take this action is the belief that a recombination of the businesses at this point will allow us to achieve greater growth,"" Leslie Wexner, chief executive of both companies, said in a statement. ""This clearer, simpler structure will allow us to fully develop the potential of our best brands across merchandise categories and distribution channels.""</br></br>Under terms of the proposal, Limited is offering 1.046 Limited shares for each Class A share of Intimate Brands. In 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Limited were down 70 cents at $17.75, while Intimate Brands slipped 40 cents to $17.50. The exchange offer values Intimate Brands at $18.57 a share, only a 6.1% premium to Intimate's current trading price. Intimate Brands hit a 52-week-high of $19 about one year ago today.</br></br>The stock price of Limited, whose brands include Limited stores, Express, Structure and Lerner New York, closely tracks that of Intimate Brands."
"Whenever Nancy Lloyd comes face-to-face with consumers, they often ask the same question: ""How do I pay off my credit cards as quickly and inexpensively as possible?"" ""Most people get this wrong,"" says Lloyd, the local author of ""Simple Money Solutions: 10 Ways You Can Stop Feeling Overwhelmed by Money and Start Making It Work for You"" (Times Books, $23), ""but the rules keep changing, so I can't really blame them.""</br></br>Lloyd rarely blames consumers for their financial pitfalls and pratfalls.. The former Federal Reserve Board economist knows firsthand how easy making wrong money decisions can be, whether paying off credit cards, purchasing a new car or buying life insurance.

"NEW YORK -- Assessing the business scene is always tricky, but especially so when views about the outlook shift as sharply as they have of late. Barely more than a year ago, with the economy in a growth recession, some forecasters worried that the expansion wouldn't make it through 1985, and now, in remarkable contrast, many foresee brisk economic growth through 1986 and well beyond. Some even suggest that the present upturn may eventually match the super-long expansion of the 1960s which, at 106 months, holds the longevity record. No one knows precisely how long this expansion will last, of course, but to assess its prospects it may be useful to compare the performance thus far with that of the record holder.</br></br>The latest upturn, which began in November 1982, already ranks among the most durable. At the 40-month mark, it dwarfs its immediate predecessor, the 12-month upswing of 1980-81, and it also now exceeds four other expansions since World War II -- of 37 months in 1945-48, 39 months in 1954-57, 24 months in 1958-60 and 36 months in 197073. The average duration of all business-cycle expansions comes to 33 months, so this one already is seven months longer than average.</br></br>It remains, to be sure, far short of the record-long 1961-69 expansion, when the Vietnam War was worsening. But if the consensus is remotely accurate, it soon will surpass the 45-month upturn of 1949-53. If it persists through the fall of next year, as many forecasters expect, it will top the 58-month expansion of 1975-80, the longest peacetime upswing.</br></br>The Commerce Department's index of leading economic indicators, to be sure, fell in January, but most analysts view this as a very brief interruption in a long-term rise. The barometer of future activity has risen in eight of the last nine months and further gains are widely anticipated. Last month's jobless-rate jump also is seen as an aberration.</br></br>It's not surprising, in such circumstances, that the current upturn increasingly prompts comparisons with its more durable predecessors, especially with the 1961-69 expansion. In such comparisons, the record book shows heartening similarities, as well as disturbing differences."

"The same ""fundamentally flawed"" system of financial rules that failed in 2008 lives on, ""but with more complexity"" in the latest proposals from regulators.</br></br>That was the blunt message on Friday from Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Director Thomas Hoenig. He was talking about the pending implementation of international bank capital standards known as Basel III. And thank goodness Mr. Hoenig is not the only voice of sanity in the regulatory wilderness.</br></br>On we told you about the Bank of England's Andrew Haldane, who has shown that in many cases Basel's expensive, complicated regulations do actual harm by obscuring the true condition of big banks. Mr. Haldane's call for simplicity struck a chord with readers. A few of their appear nearby.</br></br>Not that Journal readers ever expected a convention of global bureaucrats in a Swiss village to protect U.S. taxpayers. But Mr. Hoenig did a public service at an American Banker symposium by reviewing the relevant history from 2008: ""It turns out that the Basel capital rules protected no one: not the banks, not the public, and certainly not the FDIC that bore the cost of the failures or the taxpayers who funded the bailouts. The complex Basel rules hurt, rather than helped the process of measurement and clarity of information.""</br></br>Observing a Basel system that only grows more complicated as U.S. regulators prepare to implement the latest version, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City also pointed out that the biggest winners from such regulatory regimes are never the little guys. Mr. Hoenig explained that ""the most brazen and connected banks with the smartest experts will game the system. In private discussions, I find a good deal of uneasiness about Basel III's ability to be more effective than previous Basel efforts; however, there is a sense that we cannot go back."""
"THE PARTY TO celebrate a record for the Dow Jones Industrial Average has been postponed.</br></br>There are plenty of reasons, one of which is that not everyone got an invitation.</br></br>As the Dow industrials surged 5% in less than a month, returning almost to the record close of 11722.98 that dated from Jan. 14, 2000, two other major indexes were running out of steam and rising more slowly -- 3% for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and 1.5% for the Nasdaq Composite Index.

"SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 20 (AP)‰ÛÓBank of America, the nation's largest commercial bank, issued its economic forecast for 1973 Wednesday. The picture included reduced unemployment, increased inflation, and continued strong general economic growth. .</br></br>The unemployment rate, the bank 'predicted, will drop to 5.3 per cent in 1973, from 5.7 per cent ,this year. Inflation, however, will proceed at a 3.9 per cent clip next year, compared to 3.3 per cent in 1972, it said.</br></br>The gross national product, Bank of America; predicted, will grow at the cur-rent-dollar rate at 9.6. per cent in 1973 on top of a 9.7 per cent 2972 rise.

"In recent months, Americans have heard reports out of Washington and in the media that the economy is looking up -- that recovery from the Great Recession is gathering steam. If only it were true. The longest and worst recession since the end of World War II has been marked by the weakest recovery from any U.S. recession in that same period.</br></br>The jobless nature of the recovery is particularly unsettling. In June, the government's Household Survey reported that since the start of the year, the number of people with jobs increased by 753,000 -- but there are jobs and then there are ""jobs."" No fewer than 557,000 of these positions were only part-time. The survey also reported that in June full-time jobs declined by 240,000, while part-time jobs soared by 360,000 and have now reached an all-time high of 28,059,000 -- three million more part-time positions than when the recession began at the end of 2007.</br></br>That's just for starters. The survey includes part-time workers who want full-time work but can't get it, as well as those who want to work but have stopped looking. That puts the real unemployment rate for June at 14.3%, up from 13.8% in May.</br></br>The 7.6% unemployment figure so common in headlines these days is utterly misleading. An estimated 22 million Americans are unemployed or underemployed; they are virtually invisible and mostly excluded from unemployment calculations that garner headlines.</br></br>At this stage of an expansion you would expect the number of part-time jobs to be declining, as companies would be doing more full-time hiring. Not this time. In the long misery of this post-recession period, we have an extraordinary situation: Americans by the millions are in part-time work because there are no other employment opportunities as businesses increase their reliance on independent contractors and part-time, temporary and seasonal employees."
"NEW YORK -- Investors in the world's major bond markets are having their worst year since the early 1980s, and the final quarter probably won't bring much improvement, money managers and analysts say.</br></br>A combination of robust world economic growth, higher short-term interest rates and a strengthening dollar against major currencies has turned global fixed-income investing into a minefield. ""This has been one ugly year so far and it doesn't look like it's getting any better,"" says Kenneth Windheim, who manages a $3.5 billion bond portfolio for Prudential Capital Management International.</br></br>With the exception of Australian, Canadian and high-yield, high-risk U.S. junk bonds, government bond markets proved dismal investments in the nine months ended Sept. 30. A basket of U.S. bonds, for instance, returned only 6%, while West German, Dutch, Japanese, British and French government securities provided negative total returns of 13.22%, 12.19%, 6.79%, 5.18% and 4.56% respectively during the period, according to Salomon Brothers Inc.</br></br>""You'd have to go back to before 1984 to find a year with such poor across-the-board performance,"" says John Lipsky, a director of international bond market research at Salomon. The returns are measured in U.S. dollars and include price, income and currency changes for bonds with remaining maturities of at least one year.</br></br>Even some of the savviest money managers in the global bond market took their lumps in the first nine months. ""This isn't a market you should be messing around in if you don't know what's going on,"" says Denis Karnosky, a managing director and head of asset allocation at First Chicago Investment Advisors."
"Of course, Turner wasn't exactly a high-ranking executive. The Cibolo, Tex., man was one of the 17,000 WorldCom employees laid off on June 28. And one of many workers confused about how their companies allocate severance pay.</br></br>How do companies determine how much severance an employee receives? The question is important for many young workers who sought or are seeking jobs in the tech sector, which has, to put it mildly, been a volatile place to build a career. Knowing how much severance you can expect will help you plan your next move if you are ever laid off.</br></br>First of all, severance is not guaranteed. There is no federal law that says an employer has to give you anything when it sends you and your favorite red Swingline stapler packing.</br></br>Other countries have laws authorizing severance, however. In Canada, for example, if you have been with your employer for at least five years, you may be entitled to a week's pay for each week you were with the company, up to 26 weeks' salary.</br></br>Severance packages are fairly common in this country. A 2001 survey of 925 U.S. companies by the outplacement and career services firm Lee Hecht Harrison of New Jersey found that 79 percent had severance policies for their full-time employees. Contract workers were not usually covered."
"When the Senate acts in unanimity you can be sure you're getting a substandard product, as with Monday's 97-to-0 bill on accounting reform. But much worse may be coming. Now is when false dogmas are born, such as the universal belief that the Great Depression was caused by the stock market crash of 1929 rather than gross policy errors originating out of Washington.</br></br>Herewith, some of the canards that are likely to harden into myths, though at the moment they merely exist as lies.</br></br>Myth: CEO stock options led to telecom overinvestment.</br></br>How can this be true when virtually every major company in the country uses stock options, yet we don't have groaning overcapacity in the supermarket business or kitty-food industry? Indeed, the most visible trend in the economy has been toward leaner inventories and more efficient use of resources (aka higher productivity).</br></br>What happened in telecom was an aberration but not a novelty -- the same overinvestment and shake-out were seen in the early PC industry, the early auto industry, the early railroad industry, etc."
"The stock market has treated investors well recently. But taking a longer view, it has been downright abusive.</br></br>Even with a gain of 4% since the start of the year, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has, with dividends reinvested, lost 8% since reaching its peak in October 2007. Adjust the index for inflation, and the news is worse--it has lost 18% since August 2000. Anybody who put money into an S&P 500 index fund between late 1998 and early 2001 remains in the red.</br></br>When was the last time that so much time elapsed and the U.S. stock market still remained below its inflation-adjusted peak? Never, according to the monthly price and return data from Yale University economist Robert Shiller's reconstruction of the S&P 500 back to 1871. Even investors who bought on the eve of the 1929 crash were briefly above water, in inflation-adjusted terms, in 1937. Of course, since this owes to the deflation experienced during the Great Depression, strictly speaking the mattress was still a better place to put your money.</br></br>But while the stock market has been faring poorly, stocks have been doing better. The equal-weighted S&P 500 index, which puts all stocks on the same footing rather than weighting them by market capitalization, has beaten the regular index hands down. Since August 2000, it has returned an inflation-adjusted 52%.</br></br>A big reason the equal-weighted S&P has outperformed is that it's a sneaky way of value investing. In the late 1990s, retail investors who bought a vanilla S&P 500 fund, along with investment managers who benchmarked the sector weightings in their portfolios to the index, were loading up on expensive technology stocks. In the mid 2000s, they were buying heavily into the shares of housing and finance-related companies."
"Asian markets moved higher on Wednesday after the release of stronger-than-expected trade data from China, and U.S. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said she planned no major changes in the central bank's monetary policies.</br></br>In the biggest economic headline in Asia on Wednesday, China reported that exports climbed 10.6% in January from a year earlier, a much strong gain than the 0.1% rise that had been expected. The figure also marked an improvement on December's 4.3% growth, and a rise from a high base early last year, when exports were widely believed to have been overstated as capital flows were disguised as trade payments.</br></br>The impact was most felt in Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng Index jumped 1.5% to 22285.79. In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite gained 0.3% to 2110.79 after gaining 2.9% over the previous two sessions.</br></br>In Australia, a country with strong trade links with China, the benchmark S&PASX 200 rose 1.1% to 5310.10.</br></br>More broadly for the region, Ms. Yellen suggested in her first congressional testimony as chairwoman that the Fed would keep in place most of its easy-money policies as it gradually reduces the extraordinary bond-buying program that it has used to stimulate the U.S. economy."

"The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced the latest in a series of small changes in its measurement of consumer prices that will lop 0.1 percentage point off the nation's annual inflation rate.</br></br>Arcane details of how the consumer price index is constructed have become politically sensitive because of their potential impact on the federal budget. Because the CPI is used to calculate cost-of-living adjustments in a number of major federal benefit programs such as Social Security, any overstatement of inflation raises spending. At the same time, because the CPI is used to adjust for inflation the personal income tax brackets and the size of the personal exemption, it also influences revenue.</br></br>Fixing what the statisticians call ""formula bias"" will save the government roughly $2 billion in the first year, with the annual savings growing over time. The Clinton administration had estimated that this change would save 0.2 percentage point, taking the middle range of the BLS's earlier estimate of change, and used that higher figure in its latest budget projections. Because the change is kicking in six months earlier than planned -- it will start with the figures released in July -- the administration's estimate for 1997's budget isn't much affected.</br></br>However, the difference between a 0.1 and 0.2 percentage point reduction means the budget deficit would be about $5 billion higher in 2002 if no offsetting actions were taken, an administration official said.</br></br>The fix announced by the BLS focuses on a glitch in compiling the CPI that was discovered by BLS researchers two years ago. The problem arises when an item happens to be on sale when it is included in the CPI for the first time. When its price returns to the usual level, it gives an unwarranted boost to the index."

"With the Argentine economy showing signs of life again following the worst economic crisis in its history, President Nestor Kirchner's defiant proposal to repay only a fraction of the nearly $88 billion the country owes to creditors in the United States, Europe and Japan is rallying voters here and angering bondholders abroad.</br></br>Argentina defaulted on the bonds in December 2001, deepening a long recession and leading to a sharp devaluation of the peso. Argentina's economy grew last year for the first time in five years, by nearly 8 percent. But with 1 in 5 workers unemployed, and more than half of the country's 38 million people living in poverty, Kirchner has not budged from his insistence that Argentina cannot afford to repay the defaulted bonds at anything close to their full prices.</br></br>Kirchner's stance has come under increasing pressure from the Bush administration, the European Union and bondholders, who have begun to pursue legal action against Argentina in U.S. courts.</br></br>The dispute over the defaulted bonds could jeopardize a pact reached last year in which the International Monetary Fund agreed to reschedule more than $31 billion in debt owed to the lender. A mission from the IMF is in Argentina this week for a six-month review of the country's efforts to comply with the terms of the deal. If Argentina defaults to the IMF as well as to private creditors it would join countries such as Sudan, Somalia and other failed states in becoming an international pariah.</br></br>""If they want to squeeze, let them,"" Kirchner told reporters last week.

"Your concerns regarding the upcoming revisions of GDP (Intrinsic Value column: ""New Recipe for the GDP Leaves Sour Taste,"" Dec. 21) merit a response.</br></br>All economists understand that we now measure goods and services using a historical (read ""antiquated"") benchmark year, which overstates output. Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis updates this benchmark every five years to correct this tendency. It's this standard, periodic ""rebenchmarking"" that produces the imminent revisions to GDP that you find controversial. You confuse these with a new methodology that does away with the ""benchmark"" method and its attendant problems. In reality, our new method won't significantly affect the estimates of recent growth, but it will reduce the need for future rewrites of economic history. That's why it's widely supported among economists.</br></br>Users will still be provided with a dollar value for GDP while getting more accurate estimates of growth rates for both GDP and its components. And your concern that GDP's components won't add up to the total is overstated. The ""adding up"" error will be a few hundredths of a percentage point. Contrast that to the revisions of half a percentage point or more that the new system will obviate.</br></br>You point to a second widely known problem in the data: that they don't reflect the apparent improved quality or convenience of many goods and services. Correcting for ""quality changes"" requires a good-by-good, industry-by-industry analysis. If credible numbers existed for these effects, then we'd be using them, but they don't -- yet. In fact, the first stage of the Bureau of Economic Analysis's program to make these adjustments will be released this summer. But we're limited by resources: President Clinton's 1996 budget produced adequate funding for this task that was stripped on the Senate floor.</br></br>In essence, you argue that fixing the first problem in our data is inappropriate unless the second is fixed as well. But the alternative -- postponing this revision until the quality measurement problem was ""solved"" -- is a bad idea. To do so, as Morgan Stanley's Steve Roach suggests, assumes that the two sources of errors in GDP estimates are offsetting in magnitude when, in truth, we don't know. In essence, postponing this revision means feeding financial markets a guess as to how our output has changed, one that would have to be revised regardless once real answers were available."
"RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., plagued by lawsuits and uncertainty in the tobacco business, said yesterday that it will sever its cigarette unit from its Nabisco cookie and cracker operations, marking the end of a tumultuous corporate marriage.</br></br>The move, long urged by a group of dissident shareholders, underscores how the legal and political battles that engulfed tobacco in the past decade have left one of the United States' earliest industries with few fans on Wall Street. Despite the booming stock market, the company's stock has lost more than half its value since 1991.</br></br>Now, in hopes that investors will refocus on its core food products -- which include such brand names as Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers -- the company that produces Camel, Salem and Winston said it will spin off its domestic tobacco business to current shareholders and sell its international cigarette holdings to a Japanese firm for about $8 billion.</br></br>The news did not immediately improve investors' opinion of the company's value. RJR Nabisco's stock initially jumped 5 percent on the news but drifted down during the day, closing up only 12 1/2 cents at $28.75. ""Reynolds served up something and investors kind of yawned at it,"" said Gary Black, a tobacco analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.</br></br>The company said the complex deal will not shield it from outstanding liabilities in the tobacco business."
"Under pressure to squeeze out costs, some of the U.S.'s biggest health insurers are quietly erecting more hurdles for patients seeking medical care.</br></br>The companies are in many cases reaching back to the 1990s and boosting the use of techniques that antagonized patients and doctors alike.</br></br>Today's approaches are tweaked, but may feel familiar to many: Insurers are rolling out plans with more restricted choices of doctors and hospitals, and weighing new requirements for referrals before patients can see specialists.</br></br>UnitedHealth Group Inc., Cigna Corp. and others are increasingly requiring doctors to get prior authorization before patients can get certain care such as spinal surgeries.</br></br>Earlier versions of these practices were closely identified with the managed-care era of the 90s. They later receded in many parts of the country, as employers switched away from restrictive health-maintenance organizations, and insurers backed off some limits."
"The largest U.S. banks say they would be able to weather a severe economic crisis with higher capital levels than previously estimated, bolstering the notion that financial institutions have made headway in their quest to minimize risk and shore up their balance sheets.</br></br>J.P.

"The Senate yesterday approved a temporary extension of the U.S. debt ceiling after President Reagan promised conservative Republican senators he will support their efforts to enact budget reforms when Congress takes up a long-term debt measure in mid-July.</br></br>The legislation adopted yesterday on a 58-to-36 vote has already passed the House. It gives the United States an additional $20 billion in borrowing authority through July 17, and averts a government financial crisis that would have begun at midnight tonight.</br></br>Under the agreement reached with the White House, Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) postponed for two months his drive to tighten the 1985 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law requiring systematic reductions in the federal deficit. In exchange he said he received White House backing to use the long-term debt extension legislation as a vehicle to press for this change and for other budget reforms.</br></br>The postponement is also viewed by senior administration officials as an opportunity to forge simultaneously a compromise with the Democratic-controlled Congress on the $1 trillion fiscal 1988 budget nearing approval on Capitol Hill.</br></br>The White House and Congress remain deeply divided over the shape of that spending plan, particularly its call for an $18 billion tax increase, which Reagan has promised to veto, and a level of defense spending considerably below that sought by the administration."

"The U.S. economy has hit a bump. In the first quarter of 1998 it grew at an annualized rate of 5.4%. The final second quarter numbers aren't in yet, but it appears the economy contracted by as much as 1% or 2%. Even granting that the first-quarter figures were buoyed with inventory accumulation that was worked off in the second quarter, this reversal of fortunes is remarkable.</br></br>Asia is the culprit. The continent is in an economic tailspin. Japan has had virtually no growth for six or seven years and is now officially in a recession. South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia are all in serious trouble brought on by corruption, cronyism and fraud. Curiously, China remains relatively stable because it avoided the excesses of debt that ultimately ruined the other Asian economies.</br></br>Why does this matter to us? The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. trade deficit hit a record of $15.7 billion in May. As President Clinton noted at a news conference last Friday, ""almost the entire increase in the trade deficit is due to the Asian economic troubles."" The higher deficit may not matter much in the long run but in the short-term it forces U.S. companies to make costly production adjustments. Firms that manufacture widgets, both for export and to compete against foreign-made widgets in the U.S., will find themselves temporarily overstocked and will have to decrease production accordingly.</br></br>The trade deficit is likely to keep growing. If experience is any guide, many Asian businesses will do anything to keep their plants open, including dumping goods by selling at below market price in any market that can absorb them. Perhaps the only reason we haven't seen this dumping yet is that, because the Asian crises originated in their financial markets, export financing has been hard to come by.</br></br>International trade has boosted the U.S. economy for years, but now it is an economic drag and will remain so for some time to come. As Asian economies falter, foreign demand for U.S. goods and services falls. And as imports rise, U.S. companies find the competition tougher at home."

But budget negotiators are ""trying to raise the tax as a gimmick to reduce the deficit.""</br></br>Drew Lewis, former Transportation secretary who is chairman of Union Pacific Corp., has fired off letters to a half dozen congressional and administration budget negotiators calling the tax unfair and unnecessary. Mr. Lewis was co-chairman of a blue-ribbon commission created by Congress in 1988 to find ways to cut the federal budget deficit. Smaller railroads say they would be hit particularly hard. David Hughes, president of Bangor & Aroostook Railroad in Bangor, Maine, said he would have to cut capital spending 10% to pay the higher taxes."
". The Consumer Product Safety Commission reports that about 400,000 ‰ÛÏIn--door Gym Houses‰Û are being recalled by their maker. Creative Playthings.</br></br>The voluntary recall is being conducted because the gyms, may pose a strangulation hazard, the commission said. The commission staff said it has received two reports of young children entrapping their heads in the apparatus. In one incident an 18-month-pld baby girl was strangled; the other involved the asphyxiation of a 16-inonth-old boy who suffered brain damage, the commission said.</br></br>The gyms are designed for use by children aged 18 months to 3 years. They consist' of a hollow masonite and wood box, 30 inches high, with a two-step wooden ladder on one side and a short slide on the other side. The top ‰Û_of the box serves as a bridge between the ladder and the slide, with wooden railing on each side.</br></br>There is a 5-inch to 6-inch space between the upper rung of the ladder and the platform top, and the two children involved in the incidents trapped their heads in that space, the commission reported.</br></br>The toys were manufactured from 1962 to 1979 and sold nationwide for $29 to $50. Since January the toy has been redesigned to increase the space between the ladder rung and the platform to 7.5 inches, reducing the chance of head entrapment, officials said."
"Reading up on the financial crisis and its aftermath is unavoidable homework for anyone in business. Fortunately, Princeton economist Alan Blinder has composed the perfect crib sheet (starting with three pages of acronyms and abbreviations) in ""After the Music Stopped"" (Penguin Press, 476 pages, $29.95). Here is everything you need to know to silence any dinner-party rantings on topics ranging from Lehman's collapse to quantitative easing to Simpson-Bowles, with short primers on technicalities such as the yield curve, nominal versus real interest rates, and moral hazard. Mr. Blinder writes with an Olympian cool, waspish, never rabid. Barack Obama is ""the eloquent young president,"" Larry Summers, his former chief economic adviser, ""acerbic, domineering and argumentative."" Grimly, Mr. Blinder concludes, ""the forgetting has already begun. Unrepentant financiers, eager to return to the status quo ante, are whining about excessive regulation.</br></br>Recalcitrant politicians are bemoaning big government and itching to return to laissez-faire. The public has turned its attention elsewhere.""</br></br>Before reading Neil Barofsky's ""Bailout"" (Free Press, 270 pages, $26), it never occurred to me that Tim Geithner might be a screamer. He always seemed so mild-mannered. But according to Mr. Barofsky, the prosecutor hired as special inspector general of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the former Treasury secretary was a borderline head case. The two men fought constantly over the government's bailout of Wall Street. In one episode, Mr. Barofsky writes, ""Geithner repeatedly reached a pitch of anger, regaling me with detailed, expletive-filled explanations that established my apparent idiocy. He would then calm himself down and give me a forced, almost demonic smile."" As a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, Mr. Barofsky had once pursued Colombian drug cartels. His time in Washington made the pursuit of drug barons seem easy. As TARP opened the spigots for Wall Street, Mr. Barofsky accused the Obama administration of siding with the banks and hindering his efforts to make it a more transparent program. The author isn't always a sympathetic character, often coming across as betrayed and resentful. But his book is a raw, sincere account of the priorities and power-plays of modern Washington, which leaves you queasy about what financial disasters lie in store.</br></br>I thought I knew too much about Sheryl Sandberg's ""Lean In"" (Knopf, 228 pages, $24.95) to want to read it. I had seen the gruesome Time magazine cover of Ms. Sandberg with the headline, ""Don't Hate Her Because She's Successful."" I had read the endless newspaper coverage, the rehashing of the old ""having it all"" debates. But enough smart friends, both men and women, urged me to pick it up. The worst thing about it is what it assumes about men -- that we're all just full of it, barreling around, oblivious to luck and the biases that favor us, regarding personal and professional fulfillment as our right. Maybe it seems like this if the men you work for are Larry Summers, Larry Page, Sergey Brin and Mark Zuckerberg. These aren't your average beleaguered 21st-century males. But the best thing about the book is its wit. Ms. Sandberg keeps it punchy, provocative and involving. Agree with it or not, ""Lean In"" is irresistibly modern and thoughtful. Ignore it and you'll be in an ever-shrinking minority.</br></br>If you like your Wall Street scandals noisy and splashy, then Anita Raghavan's ""The Billionaire's Apprentice"" (Business Plus, 493 pages, $29) isn't for you. Ms. Raghavan's tale is quiet, creepy and stuffed with riveting detail. The apprentice in the title is Rajat Gupta, an Indian immigrant who rose to be the managing director of the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. He comes over as pompous and persnickety, obsessed with things like leadership conferences and the size of his office. He retired with a gold-plated set of corporate directorships. But his post-McKinsey fortune of tens of millions wasn't enough. He yearned to compete with the hedge-fund and private-equity billionaires who surrounded him in New York. The piratical Raj Rajaratnam, the now-jailed founder of the Galleon Group hedge fund, promised Gupta such riches; the price was inside information. As the judge in his insider-trading case put it, Gupta may have been a good man, but ""the history of this country and the history of this world, I'm afraid, is full of examples of good men who do bad things."" Business is also full of clever consultants who can't bear that their clients are so much richer than they are. Gupta remains free while he appeals his conviction and sentence of two years in prison and a $5 million fine. One certainly feels bad for his wife and four daughters, but the real and deserving victim seems to have been his monstrous ego. Ms. Raghavan sets her tale within the broader context of the rise of Indian-Americans in business, but it's her characters that hold the attention."
"LONDON -- Eurodollar bond prices fell 1/4 to 1/2 point yesterday.</br></br>The drop followed comments from central bankers at a conference in Boston that inflation remains a serious potential problem.

"The economic damage from Hurricane Katrina will take months to sort out, but it's not too soon to sort the good from the bad among possible government responses. The first rule of policy in a disaster should be to do no more harm.</br></br>In the category of good is the Bush Administration's decision yesterday to release some oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help Gulf Coast refiners keep operating. With oil supplies reduced, the refiners need to borrow the SPR crude or they might have to shut down. The companies will return the borrowed oil to the Reserve when private supplies are back to normal.</br></br>The Administration is also right to resist the temptation to go further and flood the market with Reserve crude, even if that would look good politically. ""The President is willing to do what it takes to relieve an oil company, but not enough to relieve the crushing burden of oil speculation and price-fixing on American consumers and small businesses,"" declared Congressman Ed Markey, thus taking the prize as the first Member of Congress to exploit this natural disaster for partisan gain. His staff should tell the Massachusetts Democrat that releasing more crude won't affect prices at the pump by one penny if the oil can't be refined into gasoline.</br></br>Far more likely to reduce gas prices is yesterday's timely decision by the Environmental Protection Agency to suspend temporarily some pollution standards on gas and diesel fuel to ease shortages. One cause of generally higher gas prices that isn't well understood by the public is the proliferation of ""boutique"" fuels to meet anti-pollution rules passed by Congressmen like Mr. Markey. These require special refining capacity, and with the shutdown of at least eight refineries it makes sense to ease these rules given the more urgent need to rebuild fuel supplies.</br></br>Even better, the EPA waived the rules for all 50 states, not just those directly hit by the hurricane. This recognizes that Katrina will end up affecting gas prices nationwide because of shortages and delivery delays, so 50-state relief ought to reduce the number of local price spikes. We wish the EPA had extended the waivers beyond September 15, but at least that's the day the EPA's requirements for summer-fuel blends expire and the industry may have winter fuel stocks ready to go."
"Two Finns are sitting at a bar, a bottle between them. They polish it off in silence and order another, at which point Finn A raises his glass and says, ""Cheers!""</br></br>By the time I landed in Helsinki last April for Finland's annual May Day celebration, this was the joke I'd been told -- by a Finn -- to sum up the northern nation's less-is-more approach to conversation. I'd been living in Iceland, Scandinavia's other oddball nation, for about a year. And I'd heard that during May Day, known as Vappu in Finland, the nation abandoned its famous shyness and let loose.</br></br>My Vappu began on the ground-floor bar of Hotel Torni, a historic downtown hotel and my base camp for the weekend. Built in 1931, the Torni, now part of the Finnish hotel chain Sokos, is renowned both for being the headquarters of Soviet bodies that remained posted in Finland after World War II and for having the best view of the city, from the women's bathroom in the hotel's rooftop bar.</br></br>Though it was Saturday and May Day wasn't until Monday, celebrations were already underway at the Torni's 1930s-era American Bar. On the bar stool next to mine, Helsinki resident Mikko Vaajamo sampled from a personal drink buffet of aged whiskey, champagne, espresso and a strawberry margarita.</br></br>""There are two days when you don't want to have visitors arriving in Finland for the first time,"" Vaajamo said. ""One is Vappu."" The other, he offered, is Midsummer's Eve, when things apparently get equally out of hand and could also give visitors the mistaken impression that Finns are always an outgoing, jovial crowd. Vappu, he said, ""is kind of a nationwide coverup story."""
"In these days of inflation and penny watching, Washington-area resideqts and businesses flocked this weekend to fetch a three-cent bargain.</br></br>Carrying their letters, cards, bills and notes, they rushed to their comer mailboxes and post offices to pay a final tribute to the three-year-old, 15-cent first class postage rate, which was replaced at 12:01 a.m. yesterday by an 18-cent rate. The cost of mailing a postcard also increased, from 10 cents to 12 cents.</br></br>423,000	pieces of mail on Saturday compared to the normal 235,000. At the city post office, where an estimated 1.5 million pieces of mail are processed on a normal Saturday, ihe volume was 10 to 20 percent higher.

"Suppose your federal government dramatically slashed tax rates for the well-to-do, all in the name of promoting economic growth. Suppose, too, that it is running a budget deficit and plans to do so for at least the next several years.</br></br>You might assume that you live in a country governed by a bunch of reckless right-wingers, willing to risk the nation's economic health for the benefit of a tiny fat-cat constituency. In fact, you reside in socialist Western Europe.</br></br>Though most of Europe's countries are ruled by left-of-center governments, taxes are coming down across the Continent. Not only are tax-loving countries like the Netherlands and Sweden cutting rates, but so are economic heavyweights like France (yes, France) and Germany.</br></br>Meanwhile, the only major industrial country that is running a large budget surplus, but where apparently respectable people still claim that it can't afford a major tax cut, is the U.S. Viewed from a European perspective, America's epic tax debate is strange indeed.</br></br>Of course, Europe's tax cuts aren't nearly as big as they might be, and opposition parties have vowed to push through bigger relief if they regain power. Yet measured by the standards of American liberals, countries like Germany are about to enjoy ""irresponsible"" tax relief. Indeed, the tax cut that Berlin started to phase in at the beginning of this year is bigger than President George W. Bush's controversial $1.6 trillion plan."

"NEW YORK -- Interest rates continued to tumble yesterday amid fresh evidence that the economy is losing steam.</br></br>The average yield at the Treasury's $4 billion sale of new 20-year, one-month bonds yesterday dropped to 11.69%, the lowest since a similar auction in June 1983. That was down from an average return of 13.76% at the previous sale of similar bonds on July 5.</br></br>Another reduction in the banking industry's prime lending rate appears likely soon, analysts say. Yesterday, First Bank Minneapolis trimmed its base rate on corporate loans to 12 1/4% from 12 1/2%. A smaller bank, National City Bank of Minneapolis, went a step further, cutting its rate to 12%. Most major banks currently are quoting a 12 1/2% rate.</br></br>""We're going to have a 12% prime rate before the month is over and further declines in November to 11 1/2%,"" predicted Joseph Bench, a vice president and economist at Shearson Lehman/American Express Inc.

"The North American International Auto Show, in residence at Cobo Hall in downtown Detroit until Jan. 23, provides a teachable moment. It turns out, lazy and overfed car companies can lose weight and come out fighting (hello, General Motors). Conversely, a stable of the smartest executives on the planet is no guarantee your company won't stumble into a clearly marked minefield (VW, I'm looking at you).</br></br>Other takeaways: It was naive of naysayers to judge an emergent technology such as electric mobility by its previous limitations. They will dine on crows in the coming years. And it's perfectly permissible for national governments to save giant employers in a moment of crisis, because flesh and blood is more important than ideological purity. Just don't make it a habit.</br></br>Interested? Antagonized? Then read on. Here are my lessons from the Detroit auto show.</br></br>Automotive engineers have the most beautiful minds: Porsche returned to the show this year after a three-year absence and brought with it the devastating Porsche 918 RSR hybrid race car, which won the annual EyesOn Design award for Best Concept. A competition version of the 918 Spyder seen last year, the mid-engine, carbon-chassis 918 RSR marries a fire-spitting 563-hp V8 with two traction motors on the front wheels, providing up to 204 hp of temporary, corner-exiting electric boost. The key component is the car's flywheel accumulator, a washer drum-sized device sitting in the cockpit that stores electrical energy mechanically, in a toroid-shaped mass spinning at up to 38,000 rpm. When required, this rotational momentum is converted back into electricity in an elegant display of the first law of thermodynamics.</br></br>It would be achievement enough to build such a car, a synthesis of horsepower and computational muscle, a car that dares the limits of physics and mechanical engineering. But to make such a car beautiful? These guys are poets with wrenches."
"Treasury bond prices pulled back, ending a seven-session winning streak, as a government report signaled that the U.S. economic recovery remained on track.</br></br>The Commerce Department on Tuesday reported that U.S. orders for machinery and other factory goods rose 3% in February, a showing that was slightly better than expected. The government also revised up the January reading for factory orders and indicated that business confidence was stronger than expected.</br></br>Bond investors also took their cues from strength in global stock markets. U.S. investors pushed the major benchmarks to new highs, buoyed by strong gains in European markets. In Asia, the Japanese stock market recouped most of its early losses and Hong Kong closed on a higher note.</br></br>The 10-year Treasury note was 6/32 lower in price in late-afternoon trading, yielding 1.861%.

"A Navy office project for up to 20,000 workers in Northern Virginia may be scaled down by as much as one-third to reflect expected cuts in the defense budget, federal officials have told five developers bidding on the contract.</br></br>The Navy project, now an $821 million proposal for at least 3 million square feet of office space, could be reduced to a less expensive plan for as little as 2 million square feet, General Services Administration officials said.</br></br>Navy sources said Friday that the request amounted to an acknowledgment that the current proposal may be too large in light of a rising federal budget deficit and projections for a scaled-down Navy in the 1990s.</br></br>Several members of Congress, including Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.) and Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.), have encouraged the Navy to reconsider the size of the project, which has been proposed for six sites in Arlington and Alexandria.</br></br>In a letter last month to Navy Secretary H.

"Higher prices for gasoline, lumber and food helped boost the value of U.S. retail sales last month, adding to concerns that the Federal Reserve may have to raise interest rates rapidly to control inflation, analysts said yesterday.</br></br>Retail sales rose 1.2 percent in May, reflecting consumers' willingness to spend more for a wide variety of goods, the Commerce Department reported.</br></br>While that bodes well for the strengthening U.S. economic recovery, it also adds to the reasons Federal Reserve officials are warning that they may have to raise interest rates more aggressively than many investors had expected.</br></br>""The retail sales data dovetail with some heightened concern about inflation,"" said Raymond W. Stone, an economist with Stone & McCarthy Research Associates. ""The inflation outlook is worse now than six months ago. . . . [Fed officials] have to worry about whether that gets ingrained in expectations"" that prices will keep rising.</br></br>More than half the increase in the retail sales figures probably resulted from consumers paying higher prices for goods, rather than from them buying more goods, according to Stone's analysis of the sales figures. The value of sales at gasoline stations alone rose 4 percent, accounting for about one-fourth of the total increase, he said."

"Inflation may be subdued today, but the debate over inflation is anything but tame. Pessimists, such as hedge-fund manager Julian Robertson of Tiger Management, say rampant inflation is a looming threat. ""I ask anyone to give me an example of an economy beefed up by huge amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus that did not inflate tremendously when the economy improved,"" he recently told us.</br></br>Optimists such as David Herro, co-manager of the Oakmark International fund, disagree. ""The global economy is soft, and there's excess capacity, so I believe inflation is still preventable,"" Herro says.</br></br>The debate over gold, considered an excellent inflation hedge by some, is equally lively. Top investors, such as Paulson & Co.'s John Paulson and Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn, placed big bets on gold in 2009. Einhorn explained his rationale at the recent Value Investing Congress: ""Gold does well when monetary and fiscal policies are poor and does poorly when they appear sensible. Prospectively, gold should do fine unless our leaders implement much greater fiscal and monetary restraint than appears likely.""</br></br>At the same conference, Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management said he avoids gold because it is ""a greater-fool investment."" In other words, making money on the yellow metal is less a function of a rise in its fundamental value and more a function of finding someone who is willing to pay you more for it. Tiger's Robertson describes his aversion to gold similarly: ""It's less a supply-demand situation and more a psychological one -- better a psychiatrist to invest in gold than me.""</br></br>Because inflation hasn't afflicted America in some 30 years, it's worth reviewing what rising prices might mean for stock investors. In a 1977 article on the subject in Fortune, Warren Buffett went to great lengths to disabuse shareholders of the notion that they could skate through inflationary times unscathed. He wrote that companies have little ability to improve returns on capital when inflation is high, so investors aren't willing to pay as much for each dollar of corporate earnings. The subpar 5.2 percent annualized return for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index from 1973 through the end of 1981, a span during which inflation rates often hit double digits, provides ample support for that argument (adjusted for inflation, stock returns were negative)."
"[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</br></br>Doubtless America would be better off if Europe got its house in order. Last year, the euro-zone sovereign-debt crisis hammered confidence, particularly on Wall Street. But there are ways that Europe's woes actually are providing a boost to the U.S.</br></br>First, Europe's weakening growth -- alongside a Chinese slowdown -- has sapped global demand for commodities. Lower raw-material prices are helping cut company costs and cap inflation. That oil prices have been moving sideways despite Iran threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz is a minor miracle. Americans can take a moment to thank their friends in Europe when gassing up the SUV.</br></br>Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield is hovering doggedly around 2%. Lately, that seems less to do with the Federal Reserve's pledge to keep rates ultralow through next year than it does with nervous foreign investors rushing into dollar-denominated debt as they seek a safe haven.</br></br>Low U.S. interest rates have helped bolster the availability of credit, supporting demand for everything from capital equipment to cars to washing machines to -- wait for it -- even houses."
"Seen from abroad, the most important story coming off Capitol Hill this week may not have involved Oliver North or John Poindexter. The disclosure by the Congressional Budget Office of new projections showing the federal deficit rising to $198 billion in 1989 also caused big ripples across the Atlantic.</br></br>The Financial Times of London gave its account of the CBO's revised projection the lead position on its front page. Since most U.S. newspapers did not give the story such treatment, why does it attract this attention in Europe?</br></br>Here this new projection looks like a body blow to the monetary strategy that Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III has been pursuing for the past six months. Baker has been skillfully buying time, waiting for the expected improvement in the trade and budget deficits to blunt protectionist pressures at home.</br></br>The sense of the deficits turning around was also supposed to encourage Japan and West Germany to take increasingly larger steps to lead international growth and help out the U.S. economy.</br></br>Baker had relied heavily on the CBO's original prediction that the deficit would come down to $161 billion by 1989. Throughout the spring and early summer, he assured the Europeans and Japanese that the United States was making significant progress in curbing its financial profligacy. Cutting $40 billion out of the deficit, he said in conferences in Paris and Venice, was nothing to sneeze at."

"Pretty soon, you may not recognize the money in your pocket.</br></br>The U.S. Mint began full-scale production of a new $1 coin yesterday, a gold-colored depiction of the Native American explorer Sacagawea that replaces the Susan B. Anthony coin. The new coin is part of a revamping of U.S. money that includes new $5 and $10 bills next year, which have the presidents' images set off-center. (Twenty-dollar bills and larger denominations already have been changed.)</br></br>With the new $1 coin, dubbed the ""Golden Dollar,"" the Mint is banking on an ambitious marketing plan, a new design and 20 years of inflation since the ""Susie's"" introduction to help the new coin succeed. Officials and even the coin's proponents say its chances of replacing the paper dollar are virtually nil. But coin-dependent entities such as mass-transit systems, the Postal Service and the $23 billion vending industry are still hoping the Sacagawea dollar will provide a boon.</br></br>""We're coming to a time when the dollar coin will probably be more useful than people would like to admit,"" said Rep. Michael Castle (R., Del.), who wrote the 1997 law paving the way for the new coins. ""Because the cost of things is higher, there are more items you simply have to spend a dollar on, so this is a good solution.""</br></br>The new coins are about the size of Susan B. Anthony dollars, will be in circulation by early 2000, and are made of an alloy of manganese, brass and copper."
"[Today's Market Forecast]</br></br>Line in the Sand</br></br>Financial officers have little to fear but the Fed itself.</br></br>Investors around the world spent the past few weeks fretting about whether the Federal Reserve will try to nip rising inflation in the bud by raising interest rates in late June. With an increase in the federal-funds rate next week to 5.25% now looking like a certainty, the focus in the days ahead shifts to whether the Fed will signal yet another increase in its benchmark interest rate in August.</br></br>A slew of economist reports out over the weekend say it is a distinct possibility that the federal-funds rate later this summer will hit 5.5%, the line in the sand for many chief financial officers."
"U.S. INVESTORS STAYED on an even keel after last week's foiled terrorist attack. But they still face an imminent threat to their portfolios: a slowing economy at home and increased interest rates abroad.</br></br>In such an environment, the dollar often suffers. When that happens, strategists and money managers tend to counsel clients to favor shares of large companies. The idea is that because these companies tend to be multinationals that earn large chunks of revenue from operations outside the U.S., they are better positioned to weather weakness at home. Also, increased overseas interest rates support foreign currencies, making earnings abroad worth more when the income is ""repatriated"" into weaker dollars.</br></br>Trouble is, the recent track record for that advice isn't what it used to be.</br></br>""In the last 14 years, there's really been no advantage to moving to large-cap stocks"" during times of dollar weakness, said Mike Thompson, research director at Thomson Financial, referring to companies with the biggest stock-market values.</br></br>The research firm compared the performance of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, made up mostly of big multinationals, with various European currencies. Sure enough, those big stocks performed better from 1976 to 1992, a time when the dollar was generally weak. That seemed logical: The stocks moved in the opposite direction of the dollar."
"The Census Bureau tomorrow will release the latest statistics on poverty in the United States, the income level of an average household and the number of Americans still lacking health insurance.</br></br>A growing chorus of experts and politicians is raising questions about the data that frame Americans' understanding of their nation's well-being. From poverty levels to health insurance, inflation to personal savings, widely accepted statistics are overstating some problems and understating others, miscounting people, and sending policymakers down blind alleys.</br></br>""We're getting at best an impressionistic sense of what's going on in the economy,"" said Rep. Rahm Emanuel (D-Ill.), who recently introduced legislation to establish an independent commission aimed at overhauling government economic statistics. ""Major policy decisions are being made based on data that is inadequate to the task.""</br></br>This seemingly technical problem has real-world consequences, allocating federal assistance to some who don't need it while cutting off others who do, raising the costs of programs like Social Security, or pushing policies for problems that may not exist.</br></br>For example, since poverty levels are not adjusted for regional costs of living, the working poor in expensive urban centers like Washington are routinely excluded from federal programs because their income lifts them above the official poverty line. The rural poor in low-cost states like Arkansas often can afford considerably higher standards of living than their urban compatriots. Yet they may be eligible for food stamps, housing aid, free school lunches and other programs that exclude the urbanites."
"WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady met with Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to try to reassure international financial markets, particularly after recent sharp declines in the Tokyo stock market and in the yen.</br></br>In a joint statement after their meeting, the two financial leaders said that they ""reaffirmed their commitment to economic policy coordination, including cooperation in the exchange markets.""</br></br>In recent weeks, Japan and, to a lesser extent, the U.S. have intervened in foreign exchange markets to try to hold down the stronger dollar and prop up the weaker yen. But in briefings after the meeting, U.S. Treasury officials didn't outline any further specific steps the two men had agreed on during their five-hour talk Friday in Los Angeles.</br></br>Mr. Brady and Mr. Hashimoto met prior to a gathering of financial leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries April 7 in Paris. The so-called G-7, which includes the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada, strives to coordinate those nations' macroeconomic policies.</br></br>In their Friday discussions, the two men covered a variety of issues, including a proposed capital increase for the International Monetary Fund; continuing talks on barriers to the bilateral economic relationship; and the planned European Bank for Reconstruction & Development, which will lend to emerging democracies in Eastern Europe."

He also said he believed a strong dollar had contributed to low U.S. inflation and stable growth. Traders said the dollar dipped following his remarks and then rallied when they realized it wasn't headed any lower.</br></br>Mr. Rubin cautioned yesterday that he wouldn't comment publicly about what he called the behavior of financial markets, but reiterated that the dollar shouldn't be used as a tool in U.S. trade policy.</br></br>Asked about Japan's economic woes, the Treasury secretary said that the U.S. has concerns about the nation's low growth rates for the past four or five years.

Baker III and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa agreed last night that the dollar's recent fall has been too rapid and that both nations should cooperate to stabilize the foreign exchange markets.</br></br>A Treasury Department statement issued after the meeting of the two finance officials said the dollar's plunge created a period of ""temporary instability"" in the exchange markets. But it stopped short of pledging U.S. intervention to prevent a further decline in the dollar.</br></br>The initial reaction on foreign exchange markets was negative in Tokyo as the dollar dropped swiftly, according to Reuters news service. Dealers said market participants considered that the results of the meeting produced nothing new.</br></br>Meanwhile, financial sources in West Germany said the Bundesbank would reduce its discount rate from 3.5 to 3 percent today, which could help stem the dollar's slide against the West German mark, Washington Post chief foreign correspondent Jim Hoagland reported from Frankfurt. {Details on C1.}</br></br>U.S. officials have said a lower dollar against the West German mark, Japanese yen and other currencies could help relieve the nation's massive trade deficit by making American products more competitive. But Japanese officials have expressed alarm at the dollar's sharp drop in recent days because it makes Japanese goods more expensive overseas and squeezes their nation's economy."

The unemployment rate, compiled from a separate survey, held steady at 7.6%.</br></br>Gold traders worry that the stronger data will lead the Fed to pare back its $85-billion-a-month bond-purchasing program, which has kept interest rates low and lent support to the gold market."
"Credit-ratings firms say they plan to delay issuing any credit-rating downgrades to the largest U.S. banks as a result of new financial regulation.</br></br>Moody's Investors Service analysts on Thursday said that, under the overhaul bill passed by the Senate last month, the government still has some room to bail out the biggest banks, at least in the short term -- an option it will likely choose as long as the economy and markets are unsettled.</br></br>""Consequently, we expect that the senior debt and deposit ratings of systemically important banks in the U.S. will continue to benefit from unusual levels of support,"" Moody's analysts wrote in a report, ""until the economic recovery is sustained, financial market health is restored, and the risks of attempting to unwind an interconnected institution are reduced.""</br></br>Moody's didn't specify which banks it considers systemically important, but the short list likely includes Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley.</br></br>The Moody's Corp. unit and McGraw-Hill Cos.' Standard & Poor's in the past have warned that the government's implied support of banks considered to big to fail means they get higher credit ratings than they otherwise would, usually between one and five notches. The ratings companies have said that any overhaul bill undercutting that support could result in downgrades."
"NEW YORK, Nov. 15‰ÛÓThe stock market suffered its steepest drop in two years today as a growing concern about the nation's sputtering economy and doubts about Washington‰Ûªs handling of the banking crisis prompted traders and investors to dump shares.</br></br>120.31	points to close at 2943.20 in trading described as heavy but not panicky.

"""Move-up"" buyers are moving back into the housing market.</br></br>As the high interest rates that long locked them in their old homes eased this spring, homeowners who want bigger or fancier dwellings became a major factor in real-estate sales. It has been five years since such buyers have been in the market so deeply, experts say, and the trend appears likely to persist -- fueled by pent-up demand among affluent baby boomers and stable mortgage rates.</br></br>""We're clearly past the bulge as far as the . . . first-time buyer being the dominant element in housing,"" says Weston Edwards, a senior executive vice president of Lomas & Nettleson, the nation's biggest mortgage banker. Now, he says, ""we're beginning to see their move-up process.""</br></br>The return of move-up buyers could reshape the housing industry. Their moves will increase the supply of more modest homes for sale, which could depress their prices. To meet demand for higher-priced homes, builders may shift away from their emphasis on small starter houses. In wealthier suburbs, housing experts expect builders to construct more expensive, custom-built homes. And since people buying higher-priced homes tend to also want lots of amenities, the building-supply industry hopes to benefit too.</br></br>The presence of these buyers is showing up in the robust figures on new- and existing-home sales. In May, for example, newhome sales rose 9.7% to a seasonally adjusted 676,000-unit annual pace, a level expected to continue throughout 1985. Builders in Ohio, Georgia, Florida and elsewhere report heightened demand for their costlier homes or plans to expand pricey subdivisions."
"Republican and Democratic lawmakers agreed this week to approve new subsidies for college students but clashed on how to offset the $6 billion cost of the measure so it doesn't add to the federal deficit, setting up a potential election-year showdown over budget policy.</br></br>House Republicans plan to vote as early as Friday to freeze the interest rates on certain federal student loans at 3.4% for the year that starts July 1. The lawmakers plan to make up the unrealized revenue by tapping money that was directed by the 2010 health-care overhaul to fund investment in illness-detection procedures. Without congressional action, the rate on the loans would double on July 1 to the 6.8% level that applies to the most commonly used type of federal student loan. Loans issued before July 1wouldn't be affected.</br></br>House Democrats are proposing to find the $6 billion by removing tax breaks for oil and natural-gas companies. Senate Democrats will suggest raising the money by ending a tax provision benefiting small-business owners, aides said.</br></br>With three different proposals and no clear path to consensus, the debate could continue until the June 30 deadline for congressional action.</br></br>President Barack Obama, seeking to energize young voters, called on Congress this week to renew the measure, which enables college students who demonstrate financial need to borrow up to $5,500 a year at an interest rate of 3.4% -- much lower than typical private loans."
"When Iowa voters walk into their state's caucuses tomorrow night, they will be kicking off a milestone campaign year that promises a new political course for America.</br></br>For the first time in 80 years, no incumbent president or vice president from either party is seeking the White House, creating an unusually unsettled campaign with no obvious front-runner. Power in Congress is divided so evenly between the two parties that neither has really been in control since the 2006 elections. Now, in the wide-open 2008 general election, voters will declare whom they want to run the executive and legislative branches.</br></br>Americans will make that choice at a time when they are distinctly uneasy. Record numbers of voters are choosing to declare themselves politically independent -- and thus open to moving either left or right. Both the Republican president and the Democratic Congress are receiving historically low public-approval ratings, another sign of voter unease. More broadly, the Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll has in recent months found the nation to be in the midst of the most prolonged period of public dissatisfaction in 15 years, as measured by the share of voters who say the country is ""on the wrong track.""</br></br>In one sense change is inevitable. This year marks the end of what can be considered the Reagan-Bush era in American politics that began when Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980. In six of the last seven general elections, a candidate named Reagan or Bush has appeared atop a national ticket, defining a brand of internationally engaged conservatism that has been the dominant strain in American politics for more than a generation.</br></br>Now the stage is set for an ideological rethinking in both parties. ""The mood for change is more than one of small incremental adjustments,"" write Republican pollster Bill McInturff and Democrat Peter Hart, who conduct the Journal/NBC News poll.

"In 1994, the good times for Washington area stocks were short-lived. They lasted only until Feb. 4, the day that the Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates. After that, and for the next 11 months, it was all downhill.</br></br>By the time the turbulent year was over, almost two-thirds of Washington area stocks had lost money. The losses cut across a wide band and hurt financial, retail, biotech, telecommunications and transportation stocks.</br></br>It also was the kind of year in which the relatively few winners fell into two categories: companies with products or services that were in high demand; and companies that, having faltered financially, were in a turnaround mode.</br></br>As often happens in periods of market turmoil, the big blue-chip stocks listed in the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index fared somewhat better than the stocks of the hundreds of smaller companies in a business community that extends from Baltimore to Richmond.</br></br>""It was a bear market and if you look at the Dow and the S&P, it doesn't reflect what happened in the broad market,"" said Prabha S.

"President Bush continues to enjoy widespread overall public support, but a new Washington Post-ABC News Poll shows that a majority of Americans worry that he is moving too slowly on a range of major domestic problems, from pollution to dealing with illegal drugs to the budget deficit.</br></br>Bush's broad support-76 percent of those surveyed approved of the job he is doing-is matched rarely when voters are asked if they approve of his handling of specific, domestic issues. On foreign affairs, large majorities favorably view Bush's responses to new Soviet arms initiatives and to recent developments in Eastern Europe.</br></br>Nine months into his presidency, support for Bush remains broad but not deep, according to the poll. Only 29 percent of the respondents said they strongly approve of the Bush presidency.</br></br>Together, the numbers appear to describe a president who is more generally liked than his predecessor, Ronald Reagan, but who does not enjoy the intensity of support that Reagan did. Reagan, nine months into his first term, had an overall approval rating of 64 percent, with more than half of that support coming from those who strongly approved.</br></br>Republican pollsters say the big surprise in recent polling numbers has been Bush's consistently high approval rating among blacks, up to 60 percent in the most recent Post-ABC poll, similar to the result among blacks in the latest survey by the Wirthlin Group, a Republican polling firm, and three times the level of black support for Reagan."

"Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>NEW YORK -- Most Treasurys ended higher on a modest relief rally after the conclusion of two days of congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.</br></br>But analysts viewed yesterday's relative calm as largely a pause after a sharp correction from oversold levels.</br></br>Last month, yields, which move inversely to prices, fell to historic lows after the Fed in early May cautioned about the risks of deflation. The market rallied strongly through mid-June, in part on speculation the Fed might use unconventional methods, such as buying longer-dated Treasurys, to ease monetary policy if the need arose.</br></br>But since late June, economists said, Fed officials seem to have tried to respond to what appeared to be a bubble-like appreciation in Treasurys. David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York, pointed to a statement by the Fed after a policy meeting in late June. ""We've certainly seen the lows in yield"" of this cycle, Mr. Greenlaw said, adding that the selloff in July has ""recorrected"" the Treasurys market back to where it was before deflation talk took hold."
"Wait til next year, forecasters said in effect as the recovery puttered along throughout much of 1993.</br></br>Well, it's almost next year and some of the same forecasters, like coaches whose team had a lousy season, will only say they're cautiously optimistic about a long-awaited expansion in the Washington economy.</br></br>Notwithstanding substantial improvement in several economic indicators at the end of the year, that's probably as unequivocal as anyone is likely to be.</br></br>Forecasting improvement in the economy in 1994 may, in fact, be one of the safer predictions of the year, though it's probably a good idea to include a caveat forecasting only modest improvement. That could change, of course. But no matter what, the local economy will continue to be an important story in 1994.</br></br>The Greater Washington Research Center may have provided a preview in mid-December when it suggested that the ""long-awaited"" expansion phase of the recovery will begin next spring as the negative forces that acted as a drag on the recovery lose their grip."
"Corrections & Amplifications</br></br>Contest Correction: Because of a calculation error and the failure to take into account a stock split, this column selected the wrong winner in last month's stock-picking contest. The real winner: Paul Zweng of Palo Alto Investors, whose selection, Palo Alto-based ClickAction, was the top-performing stock for the first six months of the year. After taking into account a 2-for-1 stock split in April, ClickAction posted a 17.4% gain for the period.

"Nine months ago, President Clinton declared before a packed House chamber that ""the era of big government is over.""</br></br>In his television ads, however, Clinton has touted his support for the Education Department, Medicare, student loans, school anti-drug programs, Social Security, gun control, job training, border patrols, federally subsidized police, government-mandated family leave, health care portability rules, a higher minimum wage, childhood vaccinations, unemployment benefits, tobacco advertising rules and tuition tax credits.</br></br>Equally important, the ads have assailed Robert J. Dole -- or, as the spots often put it, ""Dole/Gingrich"" -- for opposing these federal programs and initiatives.</br></br>""Americans are against government in the abstract but are quite supportive of it in the particular,"" said Thomas Mann, a policy analyst at the Brookings Institution. ""Clinton is relying on the public insistence that some of the things that government does are worthy activities. Many Americans believe government is incompetent and a mess and too wasteful, but there's also the fear of losing something they hold dear.""</br></br>Bill Knapp, a Clinton media adviser, said the defense of government programs in the president's ads is balanced by an emphasis on the new welfare reform law and success in cutting the budget deficit. And Clinton can claim credit for reducing the federal work force."

"Superhero movies usually include a disturbing phase when the savior-figure becomes overwhelmed by opposing forces. But, right now, the market sees no such upset for Brilliant Ben and the Fantastic Federal Reserve, as they continue their rescue of the U.S. economy.</br></br>Mr. Bernanke's extraordinary policies have undeniably succeeded in persuading investors to plow their cash hoard into riskier assets. The S&P 500 has leapt a staggering 43% in a year. Junk bonds currently yield 5.85 percentage points more than adjusted Treasury yields, according to Bank of America. That's far tighter than the 9.61 percentage points seen nine months after the 2001 recession.</br></br>Indeed, only 18 months after debt markets shut down completely, companies now seem to believe that they will be open indefinitely. For instance, Fitch Ratings recently noted that corporate borrowers have started to wait to renegotiate expiring credit facilities, believing they'll get better terms in the future.</br></br>The bull thesis is seductive. The easy money is creating self-sustaining growth in the real economy that will in turn provide the earnings needed to keep stock and bond prices rallying. And if first-quarter earnings exceed expectations, the upswing will likely continue.</br></br>What's obvious, though, is that investors are giving little credence to the idea that the Fed could slip up. Such trust might yet prove justified. A double-dip recession doesn't look imminent. Meanwhile, the market can take comfort from the fact that the Fed hasn't allowed a serious inflation break-out since the 1970s."

"When Armand Arabian stepped down as an associate justice of the California Supreme Court earlier this year, many fellow judges were taken aback.</br></br>Oversize ads in legal newspapers carried his picture and trumpeted that the ""Arabian Knight"" would now work as a mediator and arbitrator for the American Arbitration Association.

"The roaring rally in government bonds has thrown Wall Street for a loop, but it comes as no surprise to a group of veteran money managers in Austin, Texas.</br></br>Van Hoisington, president of Hoisington Investment Management Co., and Lacy Hunt, its chief economist, have been wagering for more than a decade that bond yields in the U.S. will fall, thanks to rising debt that they say inhibits economic growth, retards inflation and pushes down interest rates.</br></br>In recent weeks, Hoisington, which manages $5.4 billion invested mostly in long-term U.S. Treasury securities, has looked especially prescient, as the potential for economically damaging deflation in Europe has become a serious concern for investors.</br></br>The yield on 10-year government bonds has tumbled below 1% in Germany for the first time ever and below 2% in the U.S. for the first time in more than a year, a surprisingly low level at a time of healthy employment gains in the U.S. Prices rise when yields fall.</br></br>While many fund managers and analysts have been predicting bond yields would move higher as the U.S. economy picks up steam and the Federal Reserve prepares to wind down its bond-buying stimulus program, Hoisington disagrees. Mr. Hunt says the U.S. debt burden will continue to weigh on rates for many years, pushing bond yields down, regardless of actions central bankers around the globe might take to reflate economic growth."

"Since the 1970s, currency values have been swinging wildly, with immense impact on economies and lives. Just since 1999, the dollar has moved from $1.17 per euro to $0.83 in 2001, and to $1.27 today, matching moves in the dollar's value in terms of gold and commodities. The impact of this volatility on U.S. farmers and manufacturers, developing countries, tourism, and investment flows has been immense and disruptive.</br></br>At last weekend's G7 meeting, the powerful group of finance ministers and central bankers accepted this, asserting that exchange rates should be flexible and reflect economic fundamentals. The U.S. hopes the G7 language will form a lasting consensus and be viewed as a set of long-term currency principles. But there's a hitch: Rather than ""reflecting"" fundamentals, the exchange rate is itself a key fundamental. It affects capital flows, jobs, inflation, and interest rates. Currency changes harm the relationship between debtors and creditors and dominate the profitability of many companies.</br></br>Without considering the exchange rate, there is not even a ballpark economic definition of a country's fundamentals -- one can't tell whether monetary policy is tight or loose, or inflation likely to rise or fall. If the idea is that strong economic fundamentals cause a strong currency -- as the Clinton administration argued -- it is unclear why the Bush administration seems so comfortable with the two- year weakness in the dollar. It surely doesn't agree with the dollar- bears' claim that U.S. fundamentals have deteriorated substantially due to the tax cuts and fiscal deficits.</br></br>My view is the opposite. U.S. fundamentals are much better now than in 2000, in large part due to the change in the value of the dollar and the improved tax structure. The fundamentals are reflected in important new records in GDP, total employment according to the household survey, corporate profits, productivity and disposable personal income. The U.S. potential growth rate in coming years is one of the best on record, and hard to explain if the current value of the dollar is thought to ""reflect"" economic fundamentals.</br></br>The irony in the fascination with the G7's exchange-rate language is that the causal relationship from economic fundamentals to currencies works so poorly. The dollar reached its peak value in 2001 after the recession started. Dollar strength wasn't the sole cause -- lax regulation plus high tax rates, interest rates, and oil prices contributed -- but the dollar certainly didn't reflect U.S. fundamentals."

"Despite all the talk of tough government action to end the coal strike, no good options are really open to President Carter. In practice, application of the Taft-Hartley Act, which the president invoked yesterday, will probably bring only a fraction of the men back to work, and seizure of the mines by the government poses immense political and managerial problems.</br></br>So the best hope is to continue the negotiations on a different level. Instead of industrywide bargaining, this time the talks would have to go on a state-bystate and district-by-district basis.</br></br>Carter‰Ûªs invocation of Taft-Hartley, to be sure, looks inviting. It mandates a return to work for 80 days under the terms of the last best management offer, with a fact-finding board to try to sort out remaining differences. Thus the mines r,eopen, and there is a mechanism for adjusting unsettled issues.</br></br>But Taft-Hartley has a bad name with the unions and working people in general. Though the law provides sanctions for union officials who defy the return-to-work order, no action can be taken against spontaneous refusal to work by individual workers. The miners learned</br></br>Given the overwhelming opposition shown in the negative vote on the last offer, the strong expectation is that while union officials will urge compliance with the law, many miners will refuse.

"In a column adjacent to your Dec. 4 editorial ""The Problem of Monetarism,"" Vermont Royster refers to the ""fable of blind men confronting an elephant."" The editorial is a case in point. It considers the symptoms -- fluctuating exchange rates and monetary velocity -- and not the cause -- the unstable monetary policy of the U.S. and some other countries. Insofar as U.S. policy can be said ever to have been monetarist, it was so solely in rhetoric, never in performance. Since the Fed adopted temporarily the rhetoric of monetarism in 1979, monetary growth has been more unstable than in any other postwar period of comparable length. That hardly constitutes a monetarist policy, and it has had the anticipated results: similar instability in interest rates, the economy, and exchange rates.</br></br>An instructive example is the contrast in Japan between policy and results pre-1973 and post-1973: erratic and unstable monetary growth pre-1973 culminating in monetary growth and inflation both reaching around 25% a year; highly stable and gradually declining monetary growth post-1973 along with stability in the economy and a steady reduction of inflation. The Bank of Japan has been the least monetarist central bank in its rhetoric, the most monetarist in its policy. It has also achieved the best results.</br></br>The break in the trend of velocity, from steadily rising up to 1981 to roughly horizontal thereafter, is no mystery. So long as inflation was accelerating there was a growing incentive for holders of cash to economize on their balances; disinflation beginning in 1980 altered sharply the incentives and increased desired cash balances relative to income. The same phenomenon has been observed whenever and wherever accelerating inflation has been succeeded by disinflation.</br></br>The editorial writer may not believe it ""especially helpful to control nominal GNP,"" but that is the most monetary policy can do. The monetary authorities ultimately control only a nominal magnitude, the monetary base. Changes in that nominal magnitude do affect real magnitudes in the short run; however, their lasting effect is predominantly on nominal magnitudes -- which is why limiting monetary growth is essential to avoid inflation.</br></br>Finally, the editorial asserts that ""the world is moving toward international monetary reform, abandoning the experiment with floating exchange rates."" Another example of the blind man feeling the elephant. There is indeed ""a remarkable degree of consensus"" that it would be nice to have a better system. When is there not? The point is that everybody has a different system in mind and there is no consensus whatsoever on a specific alternative to the present system. The editorial is making the same mistake as was made some years ago by believers in the existence of a consensus on restoring a gold standard. In the course of the Commission's hearings, the appearance of consensus rapidly dissolved as it became clear that the consensus was solely on a rhetorical symbol and did not exist with respect to any specific variant of a gold standard."
"Japanese save their money at four times the rate of Americans. They maintain a distribution system that favors small mom-and-pop neighborhood stores over shopping malls. And close ties between Japanese manufacturers and their suppliers make it hard for new companies-foreign or domestic-to break in.</br></br>But the Bush administration, calling them ""structural rigidities"" that serve as major obstacles to U.S. imports, yesterday formally asked Japan to begin a series of negotiations to change them. And to underline the importance of the initiative, President Bush gave it his imprimatur by announcing it as he was leaving for Europe yesterday, one day after U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills had first revealed it.</br></br>It was seen by Japanese officials and some U.S. analysts as a way to soften the blow of naming Japan an unfair trading nation under the tough new trade law, under which Japan, Brazil and India were singled out Thursday as nations with persistent barriers to trade.</br></br>Officials said the structural-barriers initiative, proposed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, would be separate from negotiations over specific Japanese trade barriers.</br></br>Administration officials emphasized there were no penalties or timetables attached to this initiative; the trade law provision requires an end to barriers within three years under the threat of trade sanctions."
"Cool weather and the stagnant economy depressed sales at the nation‰Ûªs largest retail chains in June and deflated May‰Ûªs consumer spending kpree, analysts said yesterday.</br></br>Retailers said lackluster sales of weather-sensitive merchandise such' as air conditioners and apparel were partially responsible for the June slump.</br></br>‰ÛÏMore importantly, the poor performance .of most retailers in June reflected the still sluggish economic environment, coupled with high interest rates,‰Û said Jeffrey Feiner, senior retail analyst at Merrill Lynch,</br></br>Analysts attributed the May buying surge to cabin fever on the part of frustrated but still cautious consumers who had been snowbound by unseasonable April storms.</br></br>‰ÛÏWe do not expect to see any visible improvement in the retailing picture until the back-to-school selling season begins in mid-August,‰Û Feiner said. -Sears, the No. 1 retailer, said its sales for the five weeks ended July 3 dropped one percent to $1.85 billion from $1.87 billion in June 1981.

The February figure was revised downward significantly from the original estimate of a 66,000 gain.</br></br>Lois Orr, acting commissioner of labor statistics, said in a prepared statement that the payroll figures for March and February ""provide a marked contrast to the average monthly job losses of 144,000 that prevailed from March 2001 through January 2002.""</br></br>The jobless rate and number of payroll jobs can move in different directions for several reasons, including the fact that they result from separate surveys. The unemployment rate comes from a monthly survey of about 60,000 U.S. households, the payroll figures from a survey of roughly 350,000 businesses. Labor experts generally regard the payroll numbers as the more accurate measure of changes in the labor market, but the unemployment rate receives more public attention."
"When will interest rates rise enough to lure savers out of the stock market and send them back to the safety of certificates of deposit?</br></br>Interest rates, of course, have been rising since the beginning of this year. Blame that on a combination of the burdensome federal budget deficit, some less-gloomy business statistics and fear in the financial markets that Washington will do something stupid in trying to get the economy growing again.</br></br>But rate watchers have mainly been focusing on how these higher rates will hurt the demand for loans and impede economic recovery. Investors who were dragged into the stock market last year, when yields on CDs collapsed, should be looking at something else as well.</br></br>At some point, savers will become satisfied - although not necessarily thrilled - with CD yields again. And at least some of the many billions in cash that flowed out of CDs and into the stock market late in 1991 could make a return trip.</br></br>""It's hard to say when they will start reversing the flow,"" said David Jones, a bond market expert at the investment firm Aubrey G. Lanston & Co. But the recent rise in interest rates has already begun to slow the amount of money going into stocks."
"As David Stockman once said in a slightly different context, ‰ÛÏNone of us really understands what's going on with all these numbers.‰Û Despite 4l/a years of fast forwards and plentiful predictions of an imminent plunge, the stock market is more upbeat than a winner of the Maryland lottery.</br></br>But what if your excess cash has been parked in a money market fund, earning a measly 5 percent? Do you feel miserable each time the Dow storms through yet another record? Get sad when you realize you could have bought Home Shopping Network less than a year ago at $6 a share? (Recently, you might not want to remember, it hit $47.) Above all, don't you wish you had poured some moola into Wall Street back in '82, when the Dow stood at 800‰ÛÓa mere 40 percent of its current eminence?</br></br>Andrew Tobias, financial maven and author of such modest tomes as The Only Investment Guide You‰Ûªll Ever Need, might make you feel a little better if you missed last month, one of the greatest bull months in history.</br></br>‰Û÷The market went up about $230 billion in the first weeks of the year. But in point of fact, it went up 10 percent,‰Û he says. ‰ÛÏIf you had taken $10,000, you‰Ûªd be up 5 percent after commissions. After taxes, you'd have turned $10,000 into $10,200 or $10,300.</br></br>The Dow‰Ûªs actual increase for January was 13.8 percent, but the point still holds. Anyway, Tobias makes clear he doesn't know what's going to happen. No one does, of course, which is what fuels the market in the first place.

"Is anti-Americanism surging around the world in response to the Bush Administration's aggressive pursuit of the war on terror?</br></br>Judging from the headlines about the latest Pew Research Center survey on global attitudes, you'd think so. But while the poll, based on 38,000 interviews in 44 countries earlier this year, does show U.S. favorability ratings slipping slightly in a number of countries, the real story is the overwhelming level of support that America still enjoys.</br></br>Consider Kenya, where a drop of 14 points since 1999/2000 still leaves the U.S. with 80% approval. Or France, where favorability has actually risen one point to 63%. And remember all those worries about NATO expansion and the Administration's scrapping of the ABM Treaty? Support in Russia is up 24 points to 61%.</br></br>Nor does the U.S. rate poorly in the Muslim world as a whole. The U.S. gets high favorable marks in Indonesia (61%), Nigeria (77%) and Uzbekistan (85%). The one immediate cause for concern is Turkey, where support has fallen 22 points since 1999/2000 to just 30%.</br></br>This is surely due in part to Turkey's economic crisis, which many blame on the International Monetary Fund (and by extension the U.S.). Repeated rebuffs to Turkey from the European Union probably haven't helped encourage pro-Western sentiments either. While recent U.S. lobbying of Europe on Turkey's behalf is a good start at a fix, the U.S. will have to give on something (such as textile tariffs) too."
"With all the gratitude and acclaim surrounding Jack Valenti's recently announced retirement, no one dares confront the long-time president of the Motion Picture Association of America over the chief mystery of his 38-year reign: What happened, Jack, to all those missing moviegoers?</br></br>Despite his unquestioned eloquence, elegance and charm, Mr. Valenti presided over history's most disastrous decline in the audience for feature films. In 1965, the year before he left the Johnson administration to assume his plush position as chief mouthpiece for the entertainment industry, 44 million Americans went out to the movies every week. A mere four years later, that number had collapsed to 17.5 million.</br></br>In other words, some potent, puzzling force drove more than half of the nation's film fans to break the habit of movie going. That same mystical power served to suppress attendance for the next 20 years, with figures on ticket sales remaining flat until they began to rise moderately in the 1990s, reflecting the construction of thousands of new movie screens at multiplex theaters. Most recent figures (from 2003) show weekly attendance today at just over 30 million. As a percentage of the nation's population, however, the numbers on movie attendance remain only slightly improved from the devastating trough of 1970 (10.3% vs. 8.6%) and still vastly lower than the robust box- office years of 1965 (44%) or 1960 (45%).</br></br>It's amazing how many movie professionals remain altogether unaware of this long-term decline in film going -- or, when informed about the depressing but undeniable figures, wrongly attribute them to the advent of television. TV sets began appearing in living rooms in the late 1940s, of course, and by the time the audience for feature films started its sharpest slump in 1966, the tube had already arrived in nearly all American homes.</br></br>Hollywood originally panicked that television would destroy its business by offering for free the sort of entertainment that cost money at the local Bijou, but during the fateful 10 years of the primary TV invasion (1950-60) the audience actually declined 34%, compared with a 60% decline in those nightmarish four years of the late '60s. In later decades, the arrival of the VCR, cable TV and DVD actually corresponded to modest increases in the motion-picture audience, so no theory centered on technological alternatives can solve the mystery of the missing moviegoers."

"FRANKFURT--Euro-zone inflation unexpectedly weakened in January, raising pressure on the European Central Bank to act decisively to prevent a debilitating period of excessively soft consumer prices, or even outright declines, that threaten to derail the region's fragile economic recovery.</br></br>The report came as Germany's conservative central bank signaled it backs additional measures to combat recent volatility in money markets. The Bundesbank favors ending the ECB's policy of draining funds from banks to offset its government bondholdings, a person familiar with the matter said.</br></br>That would raise the amount of surplus funds in the banking system, the person said, and anchor money-market rates, thus providing a more stable environment for banks to lend.</br></br>Consumer prices grew 0.7% in January from a year earlier in the euro zone, the European Union's statistics office Eurostat said Friday, well below the ECB's target of just below 2%. That was down from 0.8% in December and short of economists' expectations for a slight rise. Some economists expect it to weaken further in February.</br></br>Although January's figure wasn't far different from the previous month, it carries symbolic importance. The last time inflation fell so low, in October, the ECB responded with a surprise reduction in its key interest rate to a record-low 0.25%.

""We haven't created the pent-up demand,"" necessary for a sales boom, she added.</br></br>The Big Three's cautious year-end production plans sharply contrast with the aggressive production schedules they set and mostly kept earlier this year, despite criticism by analysts that those schedules were unwarranted. Meanwhile, foreign-based U.S. auto makers are continuing their trend of boosting car production.</br></br>The U.S. operations of Japanese auto makers continue to account for a growing portion of U.S. car production.

That helped reduce inventories but, analysts say, it also prompted consumers who were considering purchasing later in the year to do so before then. The effect will be fewer car and truck sales in the coming months. Consumers also will be slow to purchase the 1990 models because some of the models carry the sharpest price rises in recent years."

"NEW YORK -- The weak dollar has rattled the U.S. bond market, but many economists and money managers still believe long-term interest rates will remain steady or drop.</br></br>Very little of the dollar's decline is related to the types of economic trends that bond traders wring their hands about, analysts say.

"Civil strife burst back into the capital city over the past week in a rapid succession of rebel sabotage actions, anti-American protests and mysterious attacks on leftist groups.</br></br>To many residents herethe violence in the last seven days stirred frightening memories of the early 1980s when street fighting and death-squad murders brought this small nation to the brink of revolution.</br></br>Although angry frustration with the three-year-old, U.S.-backed Christian Democratic government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte is widespread, he faces no danger of an urban revolt. After seven years of war, many Salvadorans feel the political alternatives to Duarte on the left and right are just as discredited, residents and political analysts said.</br></br>The events began May 28 when a noontime bomb blew off part of the roof of the offices of a left-wing committee of relatives of disappeared persons. Two employes at the committee, known as Comadres, were slightly injured.</br></br>The same day, two dozen refugees from another leftist group were occupying the city cathedral, demanding government permission to return to live in their home villages."
"Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>As oil flirted with $100 and credit markets continued to roil, stock indexes tumbled -- and tongues wagged.</br></br>Crude-oil futures stayed below the century mark today, settling 33 cents lower at $96.37. But they drove above $98 earlier in the day after a weekly government report on oil inventories showed a decline, albeit a smaller one than expected. U.S. inventories fell by 800,000 barrels; analysts surveyed by had expected a number about twice as large. In recent months, oil futures had approached and then vaulted over $90, making a march on $100 oil look inexorable. U.S. stocks plummeted on crude's gains today, although equities had often shrugged off recent crude rallies. The Dow fell 360.92 points, or 2.6%, to 13300.02, and the Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell even more on a percentage basis, losing 2.7% and 2.9%, respectively. European markets closed mostly lower, while Asian indexes were mixed. Bonds rallied. More rumblings in the credit markets also contributed to equities' slide: Moody's downgraded about $36 billion in debt securities held in so- called structured investment vehicles, and analysts at Royal Bank of Scotland Group said banks and brokers could face as much as $100 billion in write-downs on various exotic, illiquid holdings. Adding to the angst was the U.S. dollar. The greenback continued its downward spiral -- first on bearish remarks from a Chinese political official, and then on pressure from crude prices and the expectation that U.S. interest rates would stay below rates elsewhere. The euro peaked earlier at $1.4731. The British pound hit $2.1070, the first time it has broken $2.10 since 1981.</br></br>Stock indexes weren't alone in reacting to the oily mess. ""Energy prices are entirely too high, and really affecting small businesses and families all across America, not to mention our economy,"" White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Wednesday. Ms. Perino also said the Bush administration hoped lawmakers would soon move a bill that aims to cut U.S. dependence on foreign oil and boost domestic energy sources. Meanwhile, Fed governor Kevin Warsh said that oil and commodity prices were likely to put upward pressure on overall inflation in the short term. ""There are...important reasons to be concerned about the outlook for inflation,"" he said today in an address to the New York Association for Business Economics. ""Although recent readings on core inflation have been favorable, prices of crude oil and other commodities have increased. These changes most likely will put upward pressure on overall inflation in the short run."" Mr. Warsh also said the weakening dollar could lead to higher prices for imported goods. ""If these same forces cause inflation expectations to become less reliably anchored, then inflation could increase in the longer run as well."" Separately, St. Louis Fed President William Poole warned today in a speech that ""excessive"" rate reductions would run the risk of fanning inflation and spurring market volatility. Since the summer, the Fed already has cut short-term interest rates twice as an antidote to the ills of the housing slump and the credit crunch. But the Fed last week released a policy statement that appeared to close the door on further cuts in the near future even as the economy appears to be downshifting.</br></br>---"
"SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Firefighter Brian Endicott got an early taste of the pension battle brewing here when a man at the grocery store angrily pointed to the steaks in his cart.</br></br>""Who do you think you are, wasting taxpayers' money on a meal like this?"" the man yelled at 46-year-old Mr. Endicott, who was shopping for dinner with three other firefighters from San Jose Fire Station No. 1.</br></br>After the 2001 terrorist attacks, sympathetic residents of this affluent city gathered at the firehouse to offer flowers, cakes and pies. Today, public sentiment toward the men and women in uniform has widely shifted, as many locals are up in arms over escalating pension costs for public-safety workers.</br></br>In the current fiscal year ending June 30, San Jose's retirement obligations soared to $245 million, up from $73 million a decade ago, according to the city. For police officers and firefighters who have retired since 2007, the average pension is $95,336, making them among the most generously compensated in the state.</br></br>Since the recession, dozens of state legislatures and city councils across the U.S. have scaled back benefits and jobs in an attempt to plug gaping budget holes. Safety workers like police and firefighters -- who generally earn more than librarians and garbage haulers -- have often been spared from some of the most drastic cuts."
"Jorge E. Carnicero, chairman of DynCorp, won the takeover battle for the McLean government-contracting company by patiently pursuing a savvy strategy of waiting after his first bid for the company was rejected by the board, according to analysts.</br></br>A special committee of the DynCorp board last week recommended that the company accept a takeover offer from Carnicero and Synergy Group Holdings, a subsidiary of a privately held propane distributor, nearly three months after Carnicero's first bid for the company was rejected.</br></br>Carnicero's first bid-made Oct. 8, 11 days before the stock market crash-was worth about $270 million, or $25 a share. Analysts say Carnicero and Synergy will now be buying the company for about $251 million-$23.25 a share-in a complex cash and securities package.</br></br>""Carnicero has played it pretty sharp,"" said Charles Frumberg, an analyst with Mabon Nugent in New York. ""The market crashes and he sits back and doesn't do anything. Another offer comes in and runs through its various permutations and it falls apart and he steps in at a much lower price.""</br></br>The stunning turnaround for Carnicero came on the heels of a failed offer from another group of DynCorp executives, led by DynCorp President Dan R. Bannister. That offer, which went through several versions, ultimately fell through because of problems obtaining insurance and with setting up an employe stock ownership plan central to the offer. ""Bannister couldn't make it fly,"" said a source close to the company."
"WASHINGTON -- A Senate committee easily approved emergency aid for the jobless, amid signs of a Republican split over an issue that has suddenly become a top Democratic priority.</br></br>The Senate Finance Committee voted 16-4 for a measure, introduced just this week by Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas), extending unemployment benefits to more jobless workers and for a longer period in many cases. Five of the panel's nine Republicans joined all 11 Democrats in voting for the bill. Senate GOP Leader Robert Dole of Kansas, who opposed it, nonetheless indicated that he was trying to get the Bush administration to soften its opposition and back some compromise.</br></br>Meanwhile, House leaders released details of a separate measure that, like the Senate bill, is on a fast track toward possible passage before Congress departs for its August recess. The House bill would leave it to the president to decide whether the bill for added benefits would be paid for by raising taxes on employers or by declaring the spending an emergency exempt from the ceilings in last fall's budget agreement. The Senate bill, to take effect, relies on the president to designate an emergency, which administration officials oppose.</br></br>Congressional Democrats' flurry of action comes about a year after the recession began, and when it is generally thought to be ending. That delay has embarrassed many Democrats, given the party's traditional fealty to labor. But key leaders feared that any relief measure would lack sufficient votes if it meant raising the employer payroll taxes that finance the unemployment compensation system. Defending the late response, Democrats note that joblessness typically persists even as recessions wane because recovering businesses don't rush to recall workers or hire new ones.</br></br>Currently, the jobless first get up to 26 weeks of state benefits. In states with high unemployment, they can receive an extension of up to 13 weeks more at a cost shared by state and federal governments. But many unemployed workers don't qualify for the extended benefits, given state restrictions on eligibility and high thresholds for the state unemployment rates that trigger extended aid."
"Now, as heads of their respective antitrust agencies, they are espousing the same economic philosophy: that strict antitrust enforcement can help fight inflation and keep the economy healthy by reviving competition.</br></br>More important, Engman, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, and Kauper, assistant attorney general for antitrust and thus chief of the Justice Department‰Ûªs antitrust division, may have the ear of another influential Michigan alumnus:	President</br></br>Ford already appears committed to the views of his fellow Wolverines.

"The ghost of David Stockman still haunts us. It was Mr. Stockman, Ronald Reagan's budget chief, who proclaimed 27 years ago: ""I'm just not going to spend a lot of political capital solving some other guy's problem in 2010."" That other guy -- or gal -- will be the next president of the United States.</br></br>To be sure, in many ways the federal budget is in better shape today than it was in Mr. Stockman's day. As a share of the economy, federal outlays and receipts were smaller last year than in fiscal year 1982. Because outlays fell more than receipts, the federal budget deficit amounted to only 1.2% of GDP last year, down from 4% in 1982. In fact, if the economy grows as projected and Congress maintains current tax laws and spending policies, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects a federal budget surplus by 2012.</br></br>That's the good news. Nevertheless, our next president will encounter three ticking tax bombs in the weeks following the inauguration, as he or she prepares the budget for fiscal year 2010. Should even one of them detonate, we all will suffer the consequences.</br></br>The first ticking bomb is the fate of the Bush tax cuts. CBO's optimistic federal budget surplus projection is based on the assumption that Congress will allow the president's tax cuts to expire as scheduled at the end of 2010. That would trigger the largest tax increase in history (nearly $1.9 trillion over seven years), raising taxes on 115 million taxpayers, and returning to the tax rolls 7.8 million low- and middle-income families who now pay no federal income tax because of the Bush tax cuts.</br></br>If this bomb explodes, one thing is certain: It will damage the economy. The Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation estimates the tax hike would, in the short run, oblige the economy to ""flirt with recession"" or worse."
"TOKYO -- Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry urged the U.S. to slash its budget deficit so global savings can be redirected toward developing countries and the war-torn Middle East.</br></br>In its annual ""white paper"" on international trade, MITI also raised concerns about the trend toward regional trading groups, warning that ""economic integration may end up significantly reducing the world economy and world trade if the wrong method is employed.""</br></br>The annual report serves to articulate the ministry's views on the world economic situation, providing a reference point for Japanese policy makers and industrialists.</br></br>While Japanese officials have been calling on the U.S. to cut its budget deficits for the past decade, the white paper warns that the task has taken on new urgency because more funds are needed to rebuild the former East Germany, to help the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe move toward market economies, and to repair the Gulf region's infrastructure.</br></br>The U.S. budget deficit of $220.4 billion in fiscal 1990 ""is equivalent to about 5% of the gross savings of the entire world,"" the paper said. By tapping global capital markets to fund that deficit, the U.S. creates ""pressure to raise interest rates."""
"If America is looking to better its trade deficit, maybe financiers and politicians should take a look at just how the World League of American Football does business. Seriously. The WLAF was one of America's mo3t well-received exports over the last four months. Seriously.

They sometimes look past food-price increases that appear temporary or isolated while trying to control broad and long-term inflation trends, not blips that might soon reverse.</br></br>The Federal Reserve faces an especially important challenge now as it mulls the long-standing dilemma of what to make of the price of a pork chop.</br></br>As Fed officials debate when to start raising short-term interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating and causing inflation, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen has signaled she wants to take her time.</br></br>Broad measures of inflation have been running below the Fed's 2% target for more than two years, but show signs of picking up. And the unemployment rate has fallen to 6.1% from 7.5% a year ago, which suggests that slack in the labor market is diminishing and the risk of overheating is gradually rising."
"So thick has been the marijuana smoke, and so myopic is Washington about Reagan's recent misadventures, that people have not noticed the extent to which the lame duck is limping across a political landscape he has shaped to his liking. Furthermore, proof that Reagan's reservoir of luck has not run dry is this: Oct. 19, ""Black Monday,"" may help economic expansion continue past the 1988 election.</br></br>Republicans may remember it as Glittering Monday. The stock market plunge was caused, in part, by a surge in interest rates. The surge was driven, in part, by inflationary expectations. They were washed away, at least for the moment, on Oct. 19, and the washing made possible a freshet of money creation by the Fed.</br></br>Capitalism-and therefore civilization as we know it-depends on the annual Christmas shopping binge, now beginning. The stock market has not yet had a significant depressing effect on consumer spending, on which two-thirds of economic activity depends. In the automotive sector, anxieties produced by Wall Street, combined with the decline of the dollar and interest rates, have primarily hurt expensive foreign imports. Puppies (previously upwardly mobile persons) are thinking about the unthinkable-driving a domestic car.</br></br>The sobriety induced by the stock market shock will help Reagan resist a protection-ist trade bill and has put even Social Secur-ity on the agenda, at least for a while, in deficit-reduction negotiations. Here is a measure of the rightward ratchet of the Reagan years: on the eve of an election, Congress has at least considered two difficult choices.</br></br>One is ""CPI minus two""-limiting cost-of-living increases to two percentage points less than the increase in the consumer price index. An even better idea is ""two years, two percent."" The policy regarding COLAs for Social Security and military and other pensions, and all federal pay increases, would be: for two years everyone gets two percent, but only that. Everyone's ""sacrifice"" would be a slightly smaller increase. Assuming economic growth of 2.5 to 2.8 percent-an optimistic but not unreasonable assumption-Reagan could leave office with a budget deficit below $100 billion."
"Amid the chaos of recent days, as the federal government has taken gargantuan steps to stabilize the financial markets, realigning the U.S. economic system in the process, comes a nearly universal consensus: This crisis resulted from government reluctance to regulate the unbridled greed of Wall Street. Many economists and market participants who were formerly averse to government interference agree that a more robust regulatory framework must be constructed to cage the destructive forces of capitalism.</br></br>For the political left, which has long championed the need for such limits, this crisis is the opportunity of a lifetime.</br></br>Absent from such conclusions is the central role the government played in creating the crisis. Yes, many Wall Street leaders were irresponsible, and they should pay. But they were playing the distorted hand dealt them by government policies. Our leaders irrationally promoted home-buying, discouraged savings, and recklessly encouraged borrowing and lending, which together undermined our markets.</br></br>Just as prices in a free market are set by supply and demand, financial and real estate markets are governed by the opposing tension between greed and fear. Everyone wants to make money, but everyone is also afraid of losing what he has. Although few would ascribe their desire for prosperity to greed, it is simply a rose by another name. Greed is the elemental motivation for the economic risk-taking and hard work that are essential to a vibrant economy.</br></br>But over the past generation, government has removed the necessary counterbalance of fear from the equation. Policies enacted by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (which were always government entities in disguise), and others created advantages for home-buying and selling and removed disincentives for lending and borrowing. The result was a credit and real estate bubble that could only grow -- until it could grow no more."

"WASHINGTON -- U.S. banks aren't any longer tightening standards for lending to businesses, the Federal Reserve's latest survey of senior bank loan officers found.</br></br>Only 7% of domestic banks told the Fed in January that they were raising the bar to midsize and large business borrowers; in a survey conducted in November, 37% said they were. A mere 4% of the banks said they were tightening lending standards to small companies, compared with 15% in November.</br></br>When the Fed cut interest rates last fall, it cited, among other things, banks' reluctance to make loans and investors' reluctance to buy risky corporate bonds. The new Fed survey suggests that credit conditions have improved lately, though they still aren't as easy as they were in the first half of 1998.</br></br>Business demand for loans seems to have strengthened over the past three months, the new survey showed. The major factor, the bankers told the Fed, was that business customers have shifted borrowing from other sources that have become less attractive.</br></br>However, the Fed noted that U.S. branches of foreign banks continue to show a reluctance to make business loans.

"For anyone with an interest in the Great Depression, certain phrases set off chills. So when Anthony M. Santomero, president of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank, declared this week that economic recovery was ""just around the corner,"" he must have been unaware that he was paraphrasing Herbert Hoover.</br></br>The Federal Reserve's interest rate cut on Wednesday may, temporarily anyway, restore some of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's popularity. Accused of foot-dragging on the matter of priming a sluggish economy, Greenspan now seems in a full-speed-ahead mood to get things moving again.</br></br>But the Fed's action also is a sign of how worried the economic masters of the universe are about our nation's slowdown. In the dry language of Fedspeak, ""the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."" If a good inflation-phobe like Greenspan believes this, it's hard for anyone to disagree.</br></br>The question is whether our sustained national experiment with very low unemployment is about to end. The unemployment rate has spiked up, and the news of layoffs suggests the numbers are likely to get worse this year. For all the media focus on stock prices, it's unemployment that has real human and social impact.</br></br>With all those cable stations running the market ticker at the bottom of their screens all day long, it's hard to remember that in the economic lives of most people, stocks play a limited role. As David Leonhardt of the New York Times put it this week, ""Relatively few Americans rely on them for a significant portion of their income."" It's an antique notion, I know, but jobs really matter."
"Wall Street advanced solidly Friday to finish the week higher as oil prices cooled and investors embraced signs that the economy could move forward despite Hurricane Katrina's devastation of the Gulf Coast. The major indexes gained for the week.</br></br>Falling energy prices lent to a brighter economic picture in Katrina's wake, with crude oil sliding despite worries about record- high energy costs this winter and continued refinery shutdowns and gasoline futures slipping below $2 a gallon. Investors also anticipated a burst of activity once reconstruction begins in the Gulf region.</br></br>""The market seems to be concentrating on the future rebuilding of the devastated area, and I think that's what's keeping the market from declining,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at S.W. Bach & Co.</br></br>Revised forecasts from chipmakers Texas Instruments and Intel late Thursday bolstered the market with indications that consumer spending remains healthy. Texas Instruments raised its quarterly estimates -- fueling hopes for greater electronics demand and calming fears of a spending slowdown -- while rival Intel refined its previous view.</br></br>Broader stock indicators also gained ground. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 9.81, or 0.8 percent, to 1241.48, and the Nasdaq composite index advanced 9.48, or 0.44 percent, to 2175.51."
"Immediate annuities promise that your money will be there when you need it. But many investors are questioning how good those guarantees really are.</br></br>The reality is that insurance companies offering annuities can, and have, failed. But policyholders can take comfort from a well-established, industry-financed safety net. Although investments aren't always covered in full, history suggests these annuities are about as safe an investment as you can get without the full backing of the U.S. government.</br></br>That said, there's no reason to court trouble. The current environment shows why -- even in good times -- investors should seek out the strongest companies in the marketplace.</br></br>A recent Encore column discussed the ins and outs of immediate annuities. These insurance products convert your cash into income that can be guaranteed to last the rest of your life.</br></br>Many readers wondered, however, about the safety of insurance companies. And it's no wonder. The near collapse of AIG -- American International Group -- and concerns about other big-name insurers such as Hartford Financial Services and Lincoln National have made headlines."
"Bank of America Corp., facing community-activist opposition to its $46 billion acquisition of FleetBoston Financial Corp., said it will lend and invest $750 billion over 10 years in communities for programs such as affordable housing.</br></br>Some consumer advocates have been against the acquisition because of concerns that Bank of America wouldn't make affordable housing a priority. Opponents of the bank's plan said yesterday the pledge is shy of details such as how much money might be invested in a specific community such as Boston, where FleetBoston is based. Those opponents said they will make their opposition known at public hearings that the Federal Reserve Board has scheduled next week in Boston and San Francisco.</br></br>The Fed extended the original Dec. 19 deadline for public comment to allow for next week's hearings because of opposition from groups that want to ensure that Bank of America, of Charlotte, N.C., commits to lending to low- and moderate-income groups. Still, the acquisition isn't expected to be derailed.</br></br>After what was then NationsBank Corp. agreed to acquire BankAmerica Corp. in 1998, the combined Bank of America pledged to invest $350 billion over 10 years. The bank said yesterday it has completed the fifth year of that pledge. Since 1999, the bank said it has loaned and invested $230 billion in economic-development initiatives. FleetBoston is in the last year of its own five-year, $14.6 billion commitment that ultimately exceeded that amount by about $4 billion.</br></br>The new pledge replaces both of those commitments, but activists want more from the bank."
"DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. outearned much bigger General Motors Corp. for the second consecutive quarter, reporting net income of $693.3 million, or $2.61 a share, for the period ended Sept. 30.</br></br>Ford's third-quarter profit was more than double the $313.1 million, or $1.13 a share, earned a year earlier.</br></br>Meanwhile, Chrysler Corp.'s third-quarter net income fell 26%, to $234.9 million, or $1.60 a share, from $316.2 million, or $1.83 a share, a year earlier. Per-share figures for Ford and Chrysler have been adjusted to reflect 3-for-2 stock splits on June 1 at Ford and March 5 at Chrysler.</br></br>Ford attributed its earnings increase from a year earlier to higher wholesale unit sales, a more profitable product mix, improved productivity and a net gain of $102 million, or 38 cents a share, from the previously reported sales of its North American paint operation and its 70% stake in Starnet Corp. Chrysler said costs of developing and launching new products helped push its third-quarter earnings below the year-earlier level.</br></br>Ford shares spurted $3.875, to $59.125, in active trading, and Chrysler climbed $1.125, to $37.75, both in New York Stock Exchange composite trading."

"The economy grew at a robust annual rate of 4.2 percent this spring, the government reported yesterday, as consumers went on a buying spree, retailers restocked shelves, and governments loosened their purse strings.</br></br>It was the best quarterly performance for the economy in two years and a sharp turnaround from the lackluster growth rate of 0.3 percent last fall.</br></br>""This just confirms that the economy is basically in good shape,"" declared Stephen Roach, chief economist with the investment house of Morgan Stanley & Co.</br></br>The rapid expansion during April, May and June also was achieved without triggering any acceleration in price inflation -- a fact that cheered Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped more than 65 points while interest rates on the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond fell to 6.83 {Details, Page F2}.</br></br>This latest report on the gross domestic product -- the government's broadest economic gauge -- will be the last until just before the November election. Immediately it became grist for the presidential race."
"If sensible treatment for drug abuse and alcoholism were to be offered in every U.S. neighborhood, it also could improve the health of some people who have never touched drugs or taken a drink, and do this more dramatically than any research now in progress. It also could lower medical-care costs more effectively than will all the arbitrary cost-cutting that is now shaving most everyone's medical care down to the grimly skinny. The overdue task is to properly define what sensible substance-abuse treatment is.</br></br>Given the current obsession with controlling medical-care costs, what's sensible should bear some relation to what's affordable. Yet at the most publicized of alcohol- and drug-abuse treatment centers, the Fair Oaks hospital group (which sponsors the famous 800-COCAINE hotline), the current cost of a hospital day is $1,000, which exceeds the price of a day in the coronary-care unit of Massachusetts General Hospital. The cost of a full inpatient term of treatment at these centers -- four weeks to six months -- ranges from $28,000 to $160,000, with an average of $56,000. This is a spread whose lower end is higher than the cost of bypass surgery and all its attendant expense and whose upper end is more than double the average cost -- $70,000 -- of treating an AIDS patient. Most other middle-class centers cost $10,000 per term of inpatient treatment, while the Betty Ford Center charges $5,000, and Hazelden in Minnesota charges $4,000.</br></br>The reason no one questions these prices, not even the insurance companies who pay them, is that the alternative expense in addiction-related disease, lost productivity and crime is reckoned at $170 billion a year. With treatment success rates reported as high as 85% to 92% at (for instance) the Fair Oaks hospital group, the treatment prices have appeared eminently cost-effective, and the success rates miles ahead of those recorded over the past 50 years by public substance-abuse programs. The hitch, according to Dr. Chad Emrick of the University of Colorado (the only researcher to review all the literature on this subject), is that those success rates are more fantasy than fact. Both Dr. Emrick and Dr. George Vaillant, professor of psychiatry at Dartmouth Medical School, say that, even when addressed in these same expensive treatment centers, alcoholism and drug abuse remain notoriously prone to relapse -- which confuses the meaning of ""success."" Many of those treated need retreatment two or three or more times.</br></br>Given prices of $160,000 or $56,000 or even $4,000 per term of treatment, how can we afford care for those who are habitual and excessive users of drugs and/or alcohol? There are an estimated 40 million people who regularly abuse these substances. Were all of them to be treated only once at even the lowest-priced outpatient center (Hazelden, at $1,800 per term of treatment) the cost would be on the order of $72 billion. That's one-fifth of annual current medical expenses in the U.S. If, against high odds, half of these heavy users could break their habits by themselves, the remainder would still cost some $36 billion to treat -- once. What is the answer?</br></br>To begin with, Drs. Emrick and Vaillant and others have not found a scintilla of evidence to show that expensive treatment works any more effectively than less expensive kinds. Mr. Vaillant, author of the classic book ""The Natural History of Alcoholism,"" says, ""What's important is that treatment be available for everyone as often as they need it."" On just this precept, the Cambridge and Somerville Program for Alcohol Recovery in Massachusetts, developed by Harvard Medical School physicians, has for the past 16 years treated about 20,000 patients a year at an annual cost of $1 million. Its bywords are easy accessibility and versatility of approach. The program includes a 24-hour walk-in clinic, outpatient groups, groups for families, women's groups, a detoxification unit and three halfway houses. It boasts no amazing statistics or new wonder therapies, but in its humdrum and unpretentious way it weans a great many people from their injurious addictions, some permanently, others only for a while at a time. Its ""success"" rate, in short, is as good as any."
"The United States today called off its effort to drive down the value of the dollar against other currencies in return for an agreement by Japan and West Germany to stimulate their economies to help relieve the huge U.S. trade deficit.</br></br>The finance ministers of the three nations, along with those from France, Britain and Canada, said after meeting here that the dollar had declined enough, and pledged ""to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around current levels.""</br></br>Although Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III and other officials refused to say whether governments would intervene to keep exchange rates steady, the pledge to ""cooperate closely"" is likely to be seen by financial markets as an ever-present threat of that possibility.</br></br>Officials of the six nations met here over the past two days, after long preliminary discussions, in an effort to reduce the large global trade imbalances without a further sharp depreciation of the dollar, which might trigger a recession in Japan and Europe. The United States had a merchandise trade deficit last year of $170 billion, while Japan and West Germany enjoyed substantial surpluses.</br></br>Japan and West Germany promised to increase spending or cut taxes in order to stimulate demand for imports. The United States also pledged to pursue its budget deficit reduction targets."
"Once the uncool cousin to high-flying dot-coms, government contractors adopted a new swagger in 2001.</br></br>The industry continued a trend toward consolidation that strengthened already large companies going after ever-larger federal contracts. Nearly across the board, stock in such companies surged after Sept. 11.</br></br>An extreme example was CACI International Inc. of Arlington, the stock price of which nearly doubled before a 2-for-1 split in November.</br></br>Expectations for the sector are high. Before the terrorist attacks, the federal government was expected to spend $46.3 billion on information technology this fiscal year, which ends next September. Now, the Government Electronics and Information Technology Association predicts that federal spending on information technology will jump to $49 billion this fiscal year and reach $65 billion in fiscal 2007.</br></br>As the government focuses on homeland security, federal agencies are considering how to secure their computer networks and continue to offer more services to the public on the Internet."
"BULLS AND BEARS make the markets, but Barry Ritholtz witnessed something else in the past couple of weeks. ""Have you ever watched a flock of birds and all of a sudden they all break left?"" asks the strategist with Ritholtz Capital Partners.</br></br>Sure, the stomach-churning downturn in the last several sessions -- in U.S. stocks and then the bubblicious commodities markets -- was fast. But it wasn't surprising. The things that should have mattered didn't for the longest time, and now suddenly they do.</br></br>To figure out where the birds will come to roost, look homeward. Housing has been the key sector driving consumer spending, employment and therefore the markets. It was trending south long before last week's selloff, but investors have yet to fully appreciate its implications.</br></br>The Federal Reserve's rate-raising campaign has clearly started to have an impact, as long-term rates are moving up. And oil's relentless rise has finally started to bite. Crude's creep seemed merely worrisome when it hit $40 a barrel, troubling at $50 and ominous at $60, but by the time oil hit $70, investors seemed to forget about it. But the airlines and distributors that have been tacking fuel surcharges onto their wares didn't forget, and now inflation is on the horizon.</br></br>The rapid recent swoons are only the latest evidence of how dominated the markets are by aggressive speculators, especially the trend-following hedge funds that play the futures markets. These funds have been whipsawing the global markets, researcher Bridgewater Associates pointed out in a note this week."
"This year's jump in natural-gas prices looks likely to be protracted, and yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan raised the possibility that those prices could become an increasing drag on the U.S. economy.</br></br>Natural gas is used to generate electricity, heat homes and manufacture a variety of chemicals, plastics and fertilizers that in turn are used to make thousands of other products. Mr. Greenspan, appearing before the House energy and commerce committee, said higher natural-gas prices have knocked ""a couple tenths [of a percentage point] off profit margins"" for U.S. companies, which are a key determinant of business investment, currently the economy's weakest spot. At the same time, the costlier fuel is likely to mean higher bills for consumers, taking spending money out of their pockets.</br></br>Mr. Greenspan said there is little prospect for natural-gas prices to fall much in coming months. ""If we stay at these very elevated prices, we are going to see some erosion in a number of macroeconomic variables.""</br></br>The Fed is already worried about the sluggish pace of economic growth and the risk that low inflation, excluding energy prices, could turn into deflation. It may trim short-term interest rates later this month as insurance against further weakness and deflation.</br></br>The price of natural gas for July delivery rose 1.6 cents to $6.33 per million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange, more than twice the typical summer price."

"Output of American factories, mines and utilities showed a small increase last month, the Federal Reserve</br></br>The Fed‰Ûªs index of in-' dustrial production edged up from 164.1 per cent of the 1957-59 average in May to 164.4 after seasonal adjustment with consumer goods and defense equipment rising and business equipment and materials unchanged.</br></br>Most of this advance came in the second half of 1967, however. Despite concern of Administration analysts that the economy has become overheated, the increase in industrial output over the past six months has been only IV2 per cent (an annual rate of 3 per cent).</br></br>Department reported that manufacturing and trade inventories rose $650 million in May on a seasonally-adjusted basis‰ÛÓabout half the April total but nearly twice the $350 million monthly average of the first quarter.</br></br>But since factory and trade sales rose 2 per cent in May to a record $95.2 billion, the inventory-sales ratio fell from 1.54	in April to 1.51. This compared to 1.57 in May of last year. This is reassuring to economists who fear an economic slowdown if inventories should become excessive."
"WASHINGTON -- Wage and benefit costs remained contained in the last quarter, good news for inflation watchers.</br></br>Meanwhile, a jump in unemployment claims in California could portend weakness in the country's largest state.</br></br>The employment-cost index for the fourth quarter of 2000 rose 0.8% on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Labor Department said. That was down from a 0.9% increase in the third quarter and below consensus expectations of a 1.1% rise. It marked the third-straight deceleration in the ECI, a broad survey of labor costs that measures wages and benefits, since it jumped 1.4% in the first quarter of 2000.</br></br>Overall, Americans' wages and benefits grew by 4.1% for the year, the biggest increase since a 4.3% rise in 1991. Inflation rose more slowly, meaning workers saw real gains in compensation relative to the cost of living.</br></br>As long as employment costs remain low enough to keep inflation pressures down, say many economists, the message to Federal Reserve policy makers is clear. ""Despite the tight labor market, I think the Fed has a lot of flexibility in their deliberations on how to cut rates,"" said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh."
"Talk about nervous. The economy merely flexes some long-unused muscles and investors fall all over themselves heading for the exits.</br></br>No doubt about it, the economy is putting on a modest show of strength. Cars and houses are selling better, shoppers are loosening their purse strings and more people are being put to work. If this keeps up, economists predict, the economy will grow at an annual rate of between 3% and 4% in the current quarter, the best since a burst of growth in the last quarter of 1992.</br></br>But with long-term bond prices at lofty levels, interest rates at their lowest since the Treasury began selling 30-year bonds in 1977, and stock prices near record highs, early evidence of renewed growth seemed like the last thing investors wanted to see last week. To some it conjured up visions of tight supplies of goods and services, rising prices, and a Federal Reserve only too willing to fight inflation by raising interest rates to slow an overheating economy.</br></br>The result: a startling weeklong sell-off in the bond market and a two-day plunge in stock prices. Suddenly interest rates were rising and stocks looked as if they were teetering on the edge of a bear market.</br></br>""What is so amazing to me is that market psychology turned so quickly on such a small pickup in growth,"" marvels Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International."
"More Cuts</br></br>From the Fed</br></br>Seem Inevitable</br></br>When Federal Reserve policy makers wrap up their meeting today, most of Wall Street is convinced that they will cut interest rates by at least a quarter of a point.</br></br>Before that happens, the Commerce Department will release its initial take on how the economy did in the third quarter. Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires estimate gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 3.2%, down from the second quarter's 3.8%. The last time the economy grew at a better-than-3% rate for two quarters in a row was in 2004, when the Fed started raising rates. So why is the Fed, which cut its overnight target rate to 4.75% from 5.25% in September, lowering rates now?"
"Washington area companies are coming out of the hunkered-down crouch they assumed during the recession and weak recovery, making cautious plans for new hiring and investment that seem likely to fuel more rapid economic growth in the area in 1994.</br></br>In interviews with more than a dozen local business executives, a strong consensus emerged that the slow expansion would gain momentum this year, partly because companies are ready to move forward after having completed the job cutbacks and other retrenching that they carried out in response to the slump.</br></br>""I think we feel more opportunity and more optimism going into 1994 than we did going into 1993,"" said Mathias J. DeVito, chief executive of Rouse Co., in a typical comment. The Columbia commercial real estate developer plans to begin building new retail properties, something it has not done for several years.</br></br>* Giant Food Inc., which is opening three stores in new markets, also will remodel or expand five stores--a decision made in recent months.

MCI, which employs 5,300 people in the Washington area, expects to add jobs here this year as it prepares to compete with Bell Atlantic Corp. and other regional phone companies. At Cellular One, which more than doubled its work force in the Washington-Baltimore area to 406 during 1993, president and general manager Charles E. Hoffman predicted ""continued growth in 1994, as the popularity of cellular technology continues to soar."" * New business telephone hookups in the Washington area, a good indicator of future employment growth, have increased considerably, rising to 21,688 in 1993 from 15,841 in 1992."
"THERE‰ÛªS ONLY ONE one sure thing you can say about recessions: Once they get started, no one knows how deep they will go, nor how long they will last. Thus, when President Carter said during his April 17 news conference that an economic recession is now under way, but it will be ‰ÛÏmild and short,‰Ûª* that‰ÛÓlike everything else coming out of the White House these days‰ÛÓshould be chalked off as pure politics.</br></br>Moreover, the president promised ‰ÛÏa sizable drop‰Û in the inflation rate, implying that lesser oil price increases and flattening of mortgage interest rates could cut the 18 per-' cent inflation rate to around 10 percent.

"If the stock market likes to ""climb a wall of worry,'' investors are going to love January. But they'd better pet out their grappling hooks. The wall could be mighty high.</br></br>Stock prices are higher this year. The Dow Jones industrial average is up around 11 percent; broader indexes slightly more. But despite some sharp up or down sessions, stock prices have done virtually nothing since the beginning of 1991.</br></br>What started out as such a promising year for investors has turned mediocre. But mediocre is still better than bad‰ÛÓwhich is precisely the sort of year (hat the stock market deserved, given the poor performance by the nation's economy.</br></br>With the year coming to an end, professional money managers are trying to retain those mediocre profits, In the last few trading days, all that the pros are hoping for is to avoid a ‰ÛÏround tripper‰Û‰ÛÓending back where they started last January.</br></br>The pros are fairly certain that the overall stock market won't disappoint them in December. Without any unforeseen fundamental developments of major proportions, the month has historically been a good one for stocks. And unless too many of the big-money investors panic at one time and small investors suddenly come to their senses and get out of the market, this month should be no different."
"This was my 1995: I made some money in the stock market (who didn't?) as Wall Street hit a Cal Ripken-like streak of record highs. And I graduated two children (one from graduate school) who have yet to find jobs that justify the tuition outlays.</br></br>The Raspberry household is not exactly a microcosm of the U.S. economy, but it does serve to make a point about it: It is possible to do very well and quite badly at the same time.</br></br>The newest evidence is the announcement a few days ago that AT&T plans to eliminate 40,000 jobs. That cut, according to the consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., puts the communications behemoth in the No. 3 spot on the Top 10 list of corporate downsizers since 1993. IBM, which cut 63,000 jobs, leads the pack, followed by Sears, with 50,000.</br></br>That, any way you cut 'em, is a lot of jobs. And yet, as I say, the stock market has been roaring. Corporations have been making good money. Productivity is up. Inflation is holding steadily low, and interest rates are trending down. The economy is going great guns while people are losing their jobs hand over fist. The outlook is for more good economic news (as measured by the Dow) -- and for less security for workers and bleaker prospects for next year's graduates.</br></br>""I truly wish we didn't have to do this downsizing,"" AT&T's chairman, Robert Allen, told his employees. ""But the actions we are announcing today are absolutely essential if our businesses are to be competitive. . . .

"PARIS, Jan. 31‰ÛÓIn the latest development in an insider trading scandal that has become a major embarrassment for the Socialist government, French stock market investigators reported today that a close triend ot President Francois Mitterrand was among those who' profited from the transactions, and they recommended a criminal investigation.</br></br>The Market Operations Commission, after a six-week investigation set off by queries from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, concluded that insider trading crimes were committed in France in November during the $1.26 billion takeover of the U.S. company Triangle Industries Inc. by France‰Ûªs government-owned aluminum firm, Pe-chiney SA.</br></br>French officials and company executives, may have illegally passed the word that negotiations about the takeover were under way. The takeover caused the price of Triangle stock to rise from about $10 a share to its sale price of $56. Pechiney‰Ûªs president, Jean Gandois, said he believes the leak came from France.</br></br>But the commission report, which largely was in line with widespread press articles, put an official seal on charges that Mitterrand‰Ûªs longtime friend, Roger Patrice Pelat, was among six French-based individuals or companies that profited by buying Triangle stock just before the takeover and selling just after it was announced Nov. 21.</br></br>According to the investigators, Pelat and his family made more than $360,000 on trading 10,000 shares between Nov. 16 and Nov. 28. Pelat, 70, has not denied making the deal, but said he acted in good faith on information supplied by a friend out-Sco INSIDER, FG, Col. 1"

"Corrections & Amplifications</br></br>ANNTAYLOR STORES Corp. reported total sales of $66.1 million for the four weeks ended Aug. 28, up 21.4% from a year earlier. Year-to-date sales rose 21.1% to $581.2 million. Sales at stores open at least a year increased 9% in August and 12% for the year to date. Based on information provided by the company, a table accompanying Friday's Industry Focus gave year-earlier data. (WSJ Sept. 7, 1999)</br></br>Retailers rang up modest gains in sales for August, but some analysts cautioned that the pace could signal the beginning of a slowdown in consumer spending.</br></br>Overall, retailers posted respectable gains for the month, led by strength from the discount sector. But several retailers, including Sears, Roebuck & Co. and J.C. Penney Co., reported disappointing results. And the most recent gains were milder than retailers have reported for most of this year, even though August is traditionally a month when consumers are expected to spend more money on back-to-school shopping.</br></br>""We've been waiting for a consumer slowdown for four months now, ever since interest rates started climbing back up,"" said Richard Church, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. ""This could be the early sign that that process is under way."""
"Drug maker Merck is hoping it can reenter a lucrative market for arthritis painkillers, but comments from regulators today suggest it faces long odds, just as a number of analysts suspected.</br></br>Merck's Arcoxia, like the company's shelved Vioxx, is a Cox-2 inhibitor, designed to reduce the gastrointestinal damage that other painkillers may cause. However, The Food and Drug Administration said in a memo posted on its Web site that new drugs in that class should fill an unmet medical need for patients who have no other ""relatively safer"" means to manage their arthritis pain. The agency also noted that it ""remains uncertain"" as to whether most Cox-2 drugs deliver their purported gastrointestinal benefits -- it said only Pfizer's Celebrex, which remains on the market, has been shown to reduce bleeding. Vioxx was yanked off the market in 2004 after it was linked to increased cardiovascular risks, and Merck soon found itself facing thousands of lawsuits from consumers. (The drug maker has vowed to fight each claim, and it has had a mixed record in state and federal trials so far.) Under great political pressure, the FDA put ""black box"" warnings on Cox-2 inhibitors in 2005. Since then, Merck has been looking for a way to recover at least some of the $2.5 billion in annual sales Vioxx produced in 2003, its last full year on the market.</br></br>An outside panel of medical experts will vote Thursday on whether they think Arcoxia, which is already being sold by Merck overseas but fetched relatively small sales of just $265 million last year, should be given the green light by the FDA. The agency isn't bound to follow the experts' advice, though it frequently does. Many Wall Street analysts believe that Arcoxia's chances for approval are slim. Jason Napodano of Zack's Equity Research sees ""a near-term U.S. launch of Arcoxia as highly unlikely."" He thinks that regulators, who took a lot of heat over their approval of Vioxx and other Cox-2 inhibitors after word of the heart risks emerged, will be ill-inclined to stick their necks out on the drugs this time. ""We believe the FDA would be highly criticized for approving Arcoxia given the past cardiovascular risks seen with the class and the new hypertension and edema risks"" shown in a trial of the drug, Mr. Napodano noted. Many analysts aren't even bothering to build Arcoxia into their projections for Merck.</br></br>Merck remains upbeat about its outlook and even recently bumped up its profit estimates for this year. Though it's eager to replace its lost Vioxx sales, the drug giant isn't putting all of its eggs in one basket. It boasts a strong roster of newer drugs which should help to offset the large piles of cash that the company is shoveling into Vioxx litigation, as well as the loss of patent protection on the blockbuster cholesterol fighter Zocor. Among those medications is Gardasil, a vaccine for the cervical-cancer causing human papillomavirus. Merck ditched a much-criticized campaign to make Gardasil vaccinations mandatory for young girls, but Mr. Napodano thinks that it ""will be a blockbuster for Merck"" anyway. Wall Street also has high hopes for just-approved diabetes drug Janumet. Jami Rubin of Morgan Stanley, who lifted her price target on Merck from $53 to $55 today, projects it will fetch $2.8 billion in sales by 2011. Merck, which reports earnings next week, saw it shares rise slightly today, to around $46 a share, just shy of its 52-week high of $46.55.</br></br>---"

"The House of Representatives will soon vote on the question of granting the president Trade Promotion Authority, also known as fast-track approval. Some in Congress have argued that now is not the time to take up legislation that has encountered such fierce protectionist opposition in recent years. But in the wake of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 and the current economic slowdown, it is all the more important that Congress move quickly to approve this vital measure.</br></br>This bipartisan action would inspire confidence in global capital markets. It would allow America to be seen as continuing to lead the open trade and globalization that has been so vital to the prosperity of both developed and developing countries. And it would send a powerful message that the president and Congress speak with one voice, and are committed to advancing freer trade as part of the war on terror. Indeed, approval of TPA would signal that the U.S. is not only seeking a military coalition, but an economic one.</br></br>The benefits of trade hardly need illuminating. America's exports accounted for approximately one-third of our extraordinary economic growth over the past decade, and exports now support over 12 million American jobs (nearly three million more than a decade ago). Jobs supported by exports typically pay 13% to 18% more than comparable employment.</br></br>Trade brings real economic benefits to the U.S. The North American Free Trade Agreement, and the completion of the previous round of trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round), now generate annual income gains of $1,300 to $2,000 for the average American family of four. Trade is also fundamental to economic growth in the developing world. A recent World Bank study shows that nations open to trade grow 3.5 times faster than nations closed to trade. The recent experience of countries such as South Korea, China and Chile underscore that trade is a pathway to prosperity.</br></br>Trade is a two-way street, and imports also benefit the U.S. They provide consumers with more choices and lower prices on a wide variety of goods. Imports also force our industries to constantly improve and innovate in order to remain competitive with foreign exporters."

"The Federal Reserve, seeing few signs of a financial crisis in Fri-day‰Ûªs big stock market drop, yesterday added $2 billion in cash to the banking system in such a restrained way that it convinced most analysts not to look for a sharp drop in interest rates.</br></br>Some analysts said they thought the stock market drop likely would cause the Fed to lower the federal funds rate‰ÛÓthe key interest rate financial institutions charge one another for overnight loans‰ÛÓfrom about 9 percent to 8.75 percent or a bit less.</br></br>But Federal Reserve officials, like their counterparts elsewhere in government, are waiting to see whether the market decline re- i sumes. Since the economy is much i less buoyant now than it was prior 1 to the stock market crash in October 1987, any depressing impact from falling stock prices on consumer spending or business investment could virtually eliminate growth.</br></br>Over the weekend, unidentified senior Federal Reserve officials said the central bank would supply cash to the banking system to reassure investors adequate credit would be available if loans were needed as a result of falling stock prices.</br></br>But other Fed officials were uncomfortable with the published comments, arguing that they all but forced the central bank to add cash to the banking system yesterday even if it was not needed.

California's shortfall represents about one-third of the state's annual spending.</br></br>Hardly anyone will be spared as state aid to cities and towns dries up. About a half-million poor residents could lose all or part of their subsidized health care because the state says that it no longer has money.

"When Alan Greenspan appears before the Senate and House Banking Committees later this month, a primary focus of his testimony will be the Fed's target for money supply growth during the current year. The decision on that rate of increase will be made during the next two days by the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee.</br></br>There's a good reason that the Federal Reserve is required to report on its target for the growth of the money supply rather than its target for interest rates. The change in the growth of the money supply is a good indicator of where the economy is likely to be headed in the near future. While it is certainly not a perfect indicator, the increase in the broad M2 monetary aggregate (that includes small time deposits and money market mutual funds as well as checking account deposits and currency) is far better than interest rates as a guide to the future growth of total spending in the economy.</br></br>As a rough rule of thumb, experience shows that the rate of growth of total nominal gross domestic product is approximately equal to the rate of increase of M2 six months earlier. Although there have been variations in this relation from year to year, over the past two decades nominal GDP has grown at an annual rate of 8.5% while the stock of M2 has grown by 8.7%. Recent experience also conforms quite closely to this general rule: Total nominal GDP rose 3.2% from the fourth quarter of 1990 until the fourth quarter of 1991, while M2 increased by 3.3% from the second quarter of 1990 to the second quarter of 1991.</br></br>The slow growth of nominal GDP last year helped to bring down inflation. But even with only a 3% percent rise of the GDP price deflator during 1991, the 3.2% nominal GDP rise left room for real GDP growth of only 0.2% from the fourth quarter of 1990 until the fourth quarter of 1991. A decline of GDP in the first quarter of 1991 was followed by a resumption of growth in the second and third quarters but then a fourth quarter in which real GDP rose only 0.3%. For the year as a whole, real GDP in 1991 was nearly 1% lower than in 1990. This recent slowdown would probably have been avoided if the Federal Reserve had provided faster growth of M2 earlier in the year.</br></br>Looking ahead, the level of economic activity during the first half of 1992 is likely to show very little if any increase because of the very slow growth of the money supply in the second half of 1991. Since M2 grew at an annual rate of only 1.3% from the second quarter of 1991 until the final quarter of the year, the rule of thumb based on past experience implies that nominal GDP will also rise only 1.3% during the first half of 1992. Unless the inflation rate drops below 1.3%, that simple forecasting rule implies no real growth in the first half of 1992."

"Since you asked for our feedback about your article on SAT tests [""What the SAT Tests Are Really Scoring,"" Fairfax Extra, Sept. 8], I will give you my two cents as a parent of a Madison High School senior.</br></br>First of all, unlike you, I am a fan of the SAT. I think it's critical to efficiency in college admissions, given that some school districts practice rampant grade inflation and others (including Fairfax County) do not. Without the objectivity of having SAT grades, colleges would be missing a critical piece of information in their admissions processes. As I am sure you know, studies have indeed found the SAT to be a good and useful predictor of how well kids do in college.</br></br>On the other hand, I agree with you that the average SAT grade of a school's students doesn't tell one much about whether that school is a good place to learn. After all, even with the changes, it's still pretty much an aptitude test. Thus, it's going to correlate more with IQ than with the quality of teachers. Moreover, if one's goal is to get into the most selective college possible, I think there's probably a decent argument to be made that one may be better off in one of the less elite high schools, taking as many tough courses as possible and perhaps standing out more from the pack.</br></br>Your Sept. 8 column was a good piece, but it was incomplete because it did not include several relevant factors affecting SAT scores. While poverty does correlate with SAT achievement, a more powerful correlation appears to be culture.</br></br>Asians in general and the immigrants from some Latin countries have a deep cultural reverence for education that transcends economic status. On the other hand, domestic underclass culture, particularly that of many African Americans, denigrates promising black students as ""acting white,"" as if scholarship was a racial characteristic."

"WASHINGTON -- New figures from the Labor Department offered further evidence of slack productivity in the U.S.</br></br>The output per hour by workers outside the farm sector grew at a faint 0.2% annual rate in the fourth quarter, the department reported. For all of 1989, productivity rose 0.9%, the weakest advance since 1982.</br></br>Productivity is critical to economic growth and the battle against inflation. When productivity is increasing, wages -- and living standards -- can rise without higher prices. ""If we have low worker productivity, employers can't get increases {in output} and therefore the economy stagnates,"" says Sar Levitan, an economist at George Washington University here.</br></br>Partly because of the meager worker productivity, the labor cost of a unit of production jumped in the fourth quarter at a 6.7% annual rate compared with a 2.8% rate of increase in the third quarter, according to the report. In all of 1989, unit labor costs -- one of the most closely watched measures of inflationary pressures -- rose 4.6%. In 1988 they rose just 2.7%.</br></br>The minuscule productivity gains came in a quarter when there was little growth in the nation's real gross national product -- its total output of goods and services adjusted for inflation.

Other doctors are limiting the number of Medicare patients they treat even if they don't formally opt out of the system.</br></br>CMS said 9,539 physicians who had accepted Medicare opted out of the program in 2012, up from 3,700 in 2009. Some 685,000 doctors were enrolled as participating physicians last year, said CMS, which has never released annual opt-out figures before.</br></br>Want to get into B-school?

"MEXICO CITY -- Few observers expect the presence of a new governor at the Bank of Mexico to bring about a change in the central bank's monetary policy, to be released Monday.</br></br>The policy outline will be the first for Governor Guillermo Ortiz, the former finance minister who took up the post Jan. 1 following the retirement of Miguel Mancera.</br></br>As in 1997, the monetary policy in 1998 is expected to leave the peso floating freely against the U.S. dollar while keeping a lid on money supply to hold inflation to the government's budgeted goal of 12% for the year. ""We are leaning toward a tight policy to avoid a balance-of-payments imbalance,"" Javier Murcia, director of economics for Latin America at Credit Suisse First Boston said of his expectations.</br></br>Mexican economic consultant Jonathan Heath also believes policy will vary little from 1997, with one difference. ""Hopefully, there will be a mention of a contingency program, on the assumption that the current-account deficit erodes more than expected,"" he said.</br></br>The government has projected a current-account deficit of from $6 billion to $7 billion for 1997, based on an increase in imports as consumer demand recovers. The deficit stood at $4 billion at the end of the third quarter."
"WASHINGTON -- Ross Perot said he would ""absolutely not"" raise taxes as president unless ""there's some kind of incredible emergency."" But he only added confusion as to how he would slash the nation's $400 billion budget deficit by cutting spending.</br></br>In an unusual two-hour call-in program on NBC ""Today,"" Mr. Perot, who in the past has compared the nation's $400 billion budget deficit to ""arterial bleeding,"" cited war as the sort of emergency that might lead him to raise taxes. But he provided virtually no specifics as to how he would cut spending, and he even backed away from earlier suggestions that he could save $20 billion a year by cutting Social Security benefits paid to the affluent.</br></br>In his interview, Mr. Perot offered a vision of a populist presidency, saying that he would stop at red lights when traveling by car, that he would spend most of his time outside of Washington and that he would not accept any salary. ""Ross thinks he and his family are already financially secure,"" Morton Myerson, a top adviser to the Perot campaign, explained later.</br></br>While reinforcing his position as an ""outsider,"" Mr. Perot's comments raised more questions than they answered. For instance, when asked by a caller about the fate of American dairy farmers, Mr. Perot said the problem is that the dairy farmer, ""because he's small in numbers, is not properly represented"" in Washington, while other special interest groups have political action committees and ""people wandering the halls of Congress.""</br></br>In fact, dairy interests have proven themselves one of the most powerful lobbying forces in Washington, using that force to prop the price of milk above market levels. The National Milk Producers Federation has a 16-person staff in the nation's capital, and their work is amplified by lobbyists for a half-dozen dairy cooperatives. During the 1989-1990 election cycle, the Associated Milk Producers Inc., a cooperative based in San Antonio, Texas, led all farm and agribusiness political action committees, with $769,800 in contributions to congressional candidates, according to the campaign finance newsletter PACs & Lobbies."

"The American Medical Association is proud to convene the Relative Value Scale Update Committee, or RUC, a group of volunteer physicians who provide expertise to Medicare, saving taxpayers millions (""Secrets of the System: Physician Panel Prescribes the Fees Paid by Medicare,"" page one, Oct. 27). More than 300 attendees participated in the last RUC meeting, and information is publicly available.</br></br>The RUC physicians work hard to forge consensus under the strict confines of Medicare's budgetary constraints where increases for one service result in across-the-board decreases for all services. This happened in 2007 when payments for the most common primary-care service were increased. The RUC is also taking the lead in identifying overvalued services, a task the government was unable to do on its own.</br></br>While the RUC doesn't set fees and has nothing to do with the size of the Medicare payment pie, the reality is that spending on physician services rose only 2.7% in 2008, and other areas of Medicare spending are rising much faster than physician spending. In fact, inflation-adjusted physician payment fell 25% between 1996 and 2006.</br></br>Without congressional action, Medicare will cut all physician payments about 30% by Jan. 1. Congress needs to act on Medicare payment reform before Dec. 1.</br></br>Cecil B. Wilson, M.D."
"WASHINGTON -- The House, responding to lobbying by technology companies, overwhelmingly approved a bill that would limit the required ""expensing"" of stock options.</br></br>The bill overrides a proposal by a national accounting-standards panel that would have required companies to expense the value of all stock options. In their 312-111 vote, the lawmakers instead approved legislation to limit the expensing rule to options granted only to the top five officers of a company. The Financial Accounting Standards Board had proposed earlier this year that companies subtract the value of all employee stock compensation from company profits.</br></br>The House vote gives the tech lobby, led by Cisco Systems Inc. and Intel Corp., a significant victory over a weighty list of policy makers who argued against Congress intruding in standard-setting in the wake of major accounting-fraud scandals beginning with Enron Corp.</br></br>Among strong supporters of stock-option expensing as a means to improve the accuracy of financial statements are Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, Treasury Secretary John Snow, and Securities and Exchange Commission William Donaldson. Mr. Greenspan warned Congress earlier this year ""it would be a bad mistake for the Congress to impede FASB,"" because the proposed accounting for stock options ""strikes me as correct.""</br></br>Still, the measure faces stiff opposition in the Senate. Even though a comparable bill is pending in the Senate with 25 co-sponsors, Richard Shelby (R., Ala.), who chairs the banking committee, has pledged to block any effort by Congress to meddle in rule-making by FASB, an independent accounting-standards body based in Norwalk, Conn."
"The Federal Communications Commission yesterday ordered Communications Satellite Corp. to refund about $38.8 million to customers for what it alleges was four years of overcharges.</br></br>The commission in effect forgave some of the alleged overcharges, which it had estimated at about $62 million in April, saying that the rates may have been justified by economic conditions at the time.</br></br>An agreement must be worked out with the long-distance companies doing business with Comsat to pass the money through to their customers. Refunds to individuals are unlikely, one FCC official said; more likely, future rates will be cut.</br></br>Comsat declined to comment on the ruling, but in the past has argued that the FCC has no legal authority to order refunds. By law, it can appeal the decision to the commission itself or in the federal court system.</br></br>The FCC asked that a lump sum be paid after the pass-through issue is settled. The payment would be a major financial setback for Comsat, representing more than half of its $59 million in after-tax earnings in 1986. Sales that year were $467 million."
"NEW YORK -- Signs that scared depositors pushed Washington Mutual over the edge started a shareholder run from other institutions, yet WaMu's loss was a gain for J.P. Morgan Chase and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. All now await the U.S. government's progress on a rescue bill for the banking system.</br></br>The fall of WaMu, a major mortgage lender and a household name, underscored the scale of the credit crisis the U.S. government is seeking to resolve. As the housing market continues to deteriorate, it is threatening the entire financial system.</br></br>One trader at a Wall Street firm said markets were in a state of paralysis while the government rescue is in limbo. ""People are not doing anything until this bailout thing is resolved,"" he said.</br></br>Shares of WaMu were almost wiped out, falling $1.53, or 91%, to 16 cents, for a loss of 96% on the week. The concentration of loans in some of the hardest-hit areas of the housing bust eventually caused a crisis of confidence in the lender, which traces its roots to the 19th century, and it was unable to find a buyer in a recent auction.</br></br>After the failure, however, J.P. Morgan Chase stepped in to buy WaMu's banking operations for $1.9 billion. Shares of J.P. Morgan rose 4.78, or 11%, to 48.24, the Dow's leading gainer."
"By Tom Shales As tantalizing prospects go, about the only way to improve on casting Jane Seymour in a TV movie is to cast two Jane Seymours in a TV movie, which is precisely what the producers of ABC‰Ûªs ‰ÛÏDark Mirror‰Û'have done, and to captivating effect. The film, at 9 tonight on'Channel 7, is sumptuously updated film noir that can be taken as low drama or high comedy, or as a little bit of each.</br></br>twins, one as nice as pie and the other as mean as dirt.

All very well, but TV movies have always had a pretty good record on grappling with dicey topics. It‰Ûªs more a sign of coming of age that a film with only trifling ambitions like ‰ÛÏDark Mirror‰Û can fulfil them with such rich character and that director Richard Lang, also the producer, got to flex his stylistic muscles and give the film a distinctively velvety texture, not just the usual assembly-line gloss.</br></br>‰ÛÏDark Mirror‰Û is more fun and more competently brought off than all five hours of ‰ÛÏLace‰Û put together, which they weren‰Ûªt.</br></br>The story is elegant hokum.

"The banking industry stands accused and convicted, by the media and others, of engaging in lending practices that discriminate against minorities. When the New York Times reported this week that ""shamed and embarrassed"" lenders were ""finally"" opening their doors to minority groups, it quoted one advocacy lawyer as saying: ""It's a little hard to cheer too loudly; we are still in the early stages of overcoming decades of prejudice and neglect.""</br></br>Upon what evidence are these statements so confidently asserted? There is only one study of mortgage decisions that takes into account the economic characteristics of mortgage applicants, making it the only serious examination of this issue. That study, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston last fall, examined approximately 3,000 mortgages made in the Boston area in 1990. Although it found that financial attributes played the leading role in mortgage acceptance or rejection, and although it showed that minorities had financial attributes more likely to cause rejection than did whites, its bottom-line conclusion was that minorities were discriminated against.</br></br>The study has been described by regulators as ""definitive,"" and its conclusions have become part of the media's conventional wisdom. But how reliable is the Boston study?</br></br>After some prodding, the Boston Fed has finally released its data. A careful analysis reveals, alas, that the study is seriously flawed. Most important, it suggests that the study's conclusion concerning racial discrimination in mortgage lending should be disregarded.</br></br>The authors of the Fed study claim that they scrupulously weeded out errors by examining the data for inconsistencies. But a colleague and I performed several checks on the raw numbers and were astonished to discover literally hundreds of errors or likely errors."

"""We believe that a recovery has already started and that growth will be stronger than expected in the first half of this year,"" concludes Edward S. Hyman, a well-known Wall Street economist and president of International Strategy and Investment, an economic consulting firm in New York.</br></br>To support his case, Hyman argues that with the economy having been in recession for two years, consumers have been able to pay off some of their installment debt and increase their savings, and banks have had time to get healthier. Second, short-term interest rates have been halved over the past two years, and M2, a measure of money supply, has grown 4.6 percent since October, indicating that monetary policy has become stimulative. Third, in 1991 bank regulators were restrictive, and now they have become more accommodative.</br></br>Anecdotal evidence that a recovery has begun includes firming or increasing retail, auto and housing sales; better business at travel, high-tech and fast-food companies; slightly higher commodity prices; first-time unemployment claims have stabilized at 450,000; and an increase in machine-tool orders of more than 70 percent since mid-1991.</br></br>Hyman also cites the fact that the financial markets are pointing to a recovery. ""Cyclical stocks have taken the lead in the stock market. Bonds have slumped. The dollar has firmed,"" he said.</br></br>A big boost to the economy in the future will come from the fiscal stimulus of an election year, Hyman said. The 1992 federal budget, minus spending for the savings and loan rescue, will increase by a whopping 12 percent."

"NEW YORK -- A sharp drop in the dollar yesterday created fresh turmoil in the bond markets.</br></br>The dollar's slump aroused renewed concern that foreign investors may cut back on their purchases of dollar-denominated investments at a time when the U.S. is addicted to massive infusions of foreign funds. In addition, traders fear the falling dollar, which makes imported goods more expensive, will intensify pressures for higher inflation and increased interest rates.</br></br>If the dollar continues to fall sharply, the Federal Reserve might react by tightening credit slightly, raising short-term interest rates, analysts say. But most agree that a credit-tightening move isn't likely anytime soon because that could damage the economy and place additional strains on the banking system.

"Mortgage Rates and Weather Give a Boost</br></br>Existing-home sales increased briskly in most regions in the fourth quarter of 2001, even compared with strong sales a year earlier, thanks to low mortgage rates for buyers and unseasonably warm weather for builders. East South Central and Great Lakes states showed the biggest gains as their stabilizing manufacturing sectors prompted workers to go ahead with delayed home-buying plans. Similarly, sales in Rocky Mountain states were boosted by workers' confidence in some of their dominant industries, such as New Mexico's defense contractors. But sales were sluggish at best in economies more tied to the information-technology sector, notably Pacific and New England states that were overbuilt with expensive homes prior to the industry's meltdown in 2000.

"When President Obama needed a business executive to come to his campaign defense, Jim Sinegal was there. The Costco co-founder, director and former CEO even made a prime-time speech at the Democratic Party convention in Charlotte. So what a surprise this week to see that Mr. Sinegal and the rest of the Costco board voted to give themselves a special dividend to avoid Mr. Obama's looming tax increase. Is this what the President means by ""tax fairness""?</br></br>Specifically, the giant retailer announced Wednesday that the company will pay a special dividend of $7 a share this month. That's a $3 billion Christmas gift for shareholders that will let them be taxed at the current dividend rate of 15%, rather than next year's rate of up to 43.4% -- an increase to 39.6% as the Bush-era rates expire plus another 3.8% from the new ObamaCare surcharge.</br></br>More striking is that Costco also announced that it will borrow $3.5 billion to finance the special payout. Dividends are typically paid out of earnings, either current or accumulated. But so eager are the Costco executives to get out ahead of the tax man that they're taking on debt to do so.</br></br>Shareholders were happy as they bid up shares by more than 5% in two days. But the rating agencies were less thrilled, as Fitch downgraded Costco's credit to A+ from AA-. Standard & Poor's had been watching the company for a potential upgrade but pulled the watch on the borrowing news.</br></br>We think companies can do what they want with their cash, but it's certainly rare to see a public corporation weaken its balance sheet not for investment in the future but to make a one-time equity payout. It's a good illustration of the way that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's near-zero interest rates are combining with federal tax policy to distort business decisions."

"Wall Street finished an uninspired session mixed on Monday as a new high in oil prices was partly offset by a better-than-expected reading of the nation's industrial activity and strong sales at Wal- Mart Stores.</br></br>The stock market remained resilient in the face of record intraday and closing prices for oil. A barrel of light crude reached an intraday high of $62.30 before closing at $61.57, up $1, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The death of Saudi King Fahd was cited as creating uncertainty in the oil market.</br></br>The surge in oil prices was mitigated by upbeat July sales at Wal- Mart and a bullish reading of the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index -- showing that both the consumer and industrial sectors have adapted well to high energy costs. However, the strong growth in the economy raised concerns about the Federal Reserve and its policy of gradually raising the nation's benchmark rate.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 17.76, or 0.2 percent, to 10,623.15. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.17, or 0.1 percent, to 1235.35, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 10.55, or 0.5 percent, to 2195.38.</br></br>Wal-Mart rose 18 cents, to $49.53, as the retailer reported a 4.4 percent increase in sales from stores open at least a year, another strong sign of consumer spending."
"NEW YORK--The Treasury's $21 billion 10-year note sale Wednesday afternoon saw some of the strongest demand since at least the 1980s, helping long-dated Treasury securities recoup most of their early losses.</br></br>The whole market, however, remained lower ahead of Thursday's $13 billion 30-year bond auction. The 10-year note auction, an additional sale of the offering in February, drew $72.47 billion in bids--3.45 times the amount on offer. It followed a strong auction of $40 billion in three-year notes a day earlier.</br></br>Demand from foreign investors, including central banks, was stronger than the recent average in both auctions, allowing the U.S. government to continuously fund an unprecedentedly high budget deficit at historically low borrowing costs. Wednesday afternoon, the U.S. government reported its largest-ever monthly budget deficit in February as the country's fiscal year-to-date deficit ballooned more than 10% to a record of $651.60 billion.</br></br>The strong bid is even more impressive given the heavy load of corporate bond supply competing for investors' money. More than $25 billion of new corporate debt supply has flooded the fixed-income market since Monday. Even in the euro zone, easing worries about fiscal and debt problems helped Portugal sell [euro]990 million of a long-maturity government bond after planning to sell only [euro]750 million.</br></br>""The response to this auction was just astounding to us, and once again confounds those equating large issuance with a spike in yields,"" said Dan Greenhaus, chief economic and bond strategist at Miller, Tabak & Co. in New York. ""That is not to say higher yields won't materialize eventually, but for now, the Treasury is incredibly able to bring monster amounts of debt to market with almost no difficulty."""
"Treasury bond futures prices neared five-year highs in heavy trading and crude-oil futures tumbled on prospects of a weakening economy and low inflation.</br></br>Expectations of further oil-price cuts and other factors have helped extend the 2 1/2-month-old credit market rally and spark broadening interest among investors.

""It's a market that's accelerating and it doesn't seem to need much new or good information to go higher,"" said James Florsheim, an analyst with Heinold Commodities Inc., Chicago. ""There's euphoria"" among traders holding contracts to take delivery of bonds, ""and relative fear and depression from those who might want to sell,"" he said. Until the rally loses momentum, projecting its end is taking ""potshots,"" he said.</br></br>Crude-oil futures fell 45 cents a barrel to $27.02 for July delivery amid eroding prices on the spot, or noncontract, market and talk that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' ability to support prices is weakening.

"By any measure, 2008 was a brutal year for the local real estate market, as gains made during the housing boom continued to unravel.</br></br>Home sales fell throughout the region as credit dried up and buyers fearful of an increasingly uncertain job market sat on the sidelines. No local jurisdiction except the District was spared from falling home prices, and some of the hardest hit Zip codes in the suburbs had declines of more than $100,000.</br></br>Region-wide, the median sales price for single-family houses and townhouses fell 8 percent, to $382,500 from $417,000, in 2007, according to a Washington Post analysis of government sales records. The median price for condominiums also fell 8 percent, to $268,000 from $289,900. The median is the point at which half the homes cost more and half cost less.</br></br>The economic events of the year played out in every segment of the market. The wave of distressed sales -- those homes sold by banks or by homeowners facing foreclosure -- dragged down prices at the lower end. Meanwhile, the stock market's dive in 2008, 38 percent as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, kept wealthier home shoppers from committing to purchases at the higher end, real estate agents said.</br></br>""It was depressing,"" said Mark Smith, a real estate agent with Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in Gaithersburg. ""We saw an increase of properties coming on the market, a decrease of credit flowing to what banks consider 'marginally qualified people' and an increase in short sales and foreclosures."""
"I HAVE DISCOVERED the root of all financial evil and it isn't stockbrokers, the tax code or even credit cards. Instead, the real culprit is the big house.</br></br>Hyperbole? Of course, it's hyperbole. But there is a nugget of truth here. Bear with me while I explain.</br></br>-- More for Less: According to the U.S. Census Bureau, newly constructed single-family homes had a median size of 2,114 square feet in 2002, up from 1,520 square feet in 1982. That's a 39% increase in 20 years. Existing homes would also have grown in size, as homeowners tacked on additions, but the increase wouldn't have been as much as 39%.</br></br>How much is all this extra space costing us? At first blush, it doesn't seem to be costing much at all. The reason: Even as homes have ballooned in size, interest rates have tumbled.</br></br>To illustrate what a bonanza this fall in rates has been, consider the monthly mortgage payments on two homes, a smaller 1,520-square- foot house costing $130,544 and a larger 2,114-square-foot house valued at $188,141. (These estimated home values are based on national averages. Prices for either home would obviously be much higher in some parts of the country.) In both cases, assume you put down 20% and borrowed the other 80% through a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage."

"U.S. Treasury prices rebounded late yesterday into positive territory after the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's last meeting proved less severe than expected.</br></br>Market participants had been braced for tougher talk on inflation in the minutes, especially after one member of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee opposed the decision to pause at the Aug. 8 meeting.</br></br>Instead, market participants interpreted the Fed minutes as reiterating what they already knew -- namely that the central bank would continue to watch inflation but was comfortable leaving rates unchanged to better gauge the impact of its policy on the economy.</br></br>This encouraged investors to move in and buy Treasurys after they had spent much of session earlier selling government securities.</br></br>""The market had prepared itself that the statement would be much more negative with regard to inflation and possible future rate hikes,"" said Gary Pollack, managing director of Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management in New York."
"NEW YORK -- Anxiety about developments in the Middle East, inflationary fears and the dollar's weakness in world foreign-exchange markets sent gold-futures prices surging $6.60 an ounce.</br></br>December gold ended at $417.90, just a dime shy of the day's highest trade, after reports of new threats by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</br></br>""This market is strictly being run by Iraq,"" said William O'Neill, senior futures strategist at Merrill Lynch. ""Any sign of heightened tension is immediately being reflected in the gold market.""</br></br>At the same time, he added, the rise in the price of gold reflected problems of the dollar and concern about inflation following release of the consumer price index for July. The government report showed that prices, excluding energy and food, rose 0.6%. Expectations had been for an increase of about 0.4%, Mr. O'Neill said.</br></br>Meanwhile, the U.S. Mint reported that sales of American Eagle gold coins are soaring, a strong indication of a flight to safety and away from dollar-denominated assets. In the first 14 days of August, sales of the coin totaled 44,000 ounces, the Mint said, more than in each of the three preceding months. Sales of the one-ounce version of the coin accounted for 41,500 ounces, a spokesman said."
"Global finance is mysterious, exciting and sometimes reckless. A specter now haunts it -- the specter of excess ""liquidity."" Will this prove a passing anxiety or, as in 1997 and 1998 with the Asian financial crisis, will it threaten the stability of the entire global economy? Good question.</br></br>""Liquidity"" is a common, but confusing, economic metaphor. Financial markets (say, stock and bond markets) are said to be ""liquid"" when it's easy to buy and sell. Transactions flow smoothly. By contrast, either buyers or sellers are scarce in an ""illiquid"" market. Prices move sharply, up or down. Markets can also have too much liquidity: Investors may take increasingly large risks to put their abundant funds to use. ""Bubbles"" can form. Losses may follow.</br></br>Just recently, HSBC -- a major bank holding company -- announced more than $10 billion in losses on so-called ""subprime"" home mortgages. Representing about 20 percent of new mortgages in 2006, subprime loans go to weaker borrowers with shakier credit histories. When borrowers are less creditworthy, their loans carry higher interest rates. Hence, the appeal to lenders. Now, losses are emerging.</br></br>What's unclear is whether the subprime losses are an isolated event or a harbinger of wider investment blunders.</br></br>In the past quarter-century, points out economist Richard Berner of Morgan Stanley, the financial system -- the way that savings are channeled into investments -- has changed in three fundamental ways."
"Why is MetLife Inc., a New York-based company with a large number of insurance customers in the World Trade Center, fretting about folks in the heartland? Because it expects to pay disability claims to customers far from ground zero.</br></br>That includes ""the worker in Kansas City who is having some nervous disorder just because they watch the war on terror on CNN,"" says Rob Henrikson, president of MetLife's institutional life-insurance business. MetLife has established $83 million in reserves, largely to cover that type of disability claim, though it won't give a specific breakdown.</br></br>Although the life-insurance industry has taken a relatively light hit from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, it nonetheless has been affected by the strikes and their aftermath. Analysts estimate life-insurance companies will have losses of between $3 billion and $6 billion related to Sept. 11, much smaller than the estimated $40 billion to $70 billion in insured losses expected to be paid by property-casualty insurers.</br></br>Of course, the biggest cost for the industry will be paying life-insurance claims for people killed in the attacks. But the industry is also bracing for an increase in disability claims, and not just from workers hurt in downtown Manhattan.</br></br>MetLife, which reported a 33% drop in its net income on Tuesday, said disability claims rise anyway during recessions. ""When the economy worsens there tends to be a pickup in incidents,"" adds Joan Zief, a life-insurance analyst at Goldman Sachs. ""The cynic might say that when people are worried about losing their jobs they are more apt to go on disability to maintain an income."""
"The high-tech industry, the supposed savior of sagging economies everywhere, is seriously overrated as an answer to unemployment and recession, industry observers report.</br></br>A forest of myths obscures some unpleasant realities: high tech creates few jobs, accounting for only about 8 percent of total U.S. employment; the jobs it creates are primarily middle-level ones, rather than either very highly skilled or assembly-line positions; it is not, in many cases, a ‰ÛÏclean‰Û industry, and it is dominated by a few giant corporations.</br></br>Local jurisdictions, trade groups and federal agencies monitoring the industry have their own, frequently widely varying definitions of a high-tech company. As a result, there is widespread disagreement on how much employment should be credited to these firms.</br></br>The National Science Foundation, the U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics and many experts, such as Robert Z. Lawrence, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, use narrower definitions than those of most local jurisdictions and boards of trade, which often count firms with slight connections to high tech.</br></br>Montgomery County, for example, includes a contact lens manufacturer in its high-tech biological and medical firms, and a general management consulting company among its high-tech computer firms, according to a Greater Washington Research Center report."

"WASHINGTON -- Business leaders and bankers across the country feel the economy is improving, but slowly and unevenly with no real major bright spots.</br></br>Their opinions, summarized in the latest report from the Federal Reserve's regional banks, offer further evidence that the country's climb out of the recession may not be a strong one.</br></br>Retailers in particular said there was little evidence of strength in consumer spending. Most of the 12 district Federal Reserve banks reported that retail sales were flat or down during June and July. Retailers in the Fed district of New York said the heat wave kept shoppers out of their stores unless they happened to need fans or air conditioners. And half the retailers in the Richmond, Va., area told the Fed they thought the economy was still in a downturn, while fewer than a third said they thought the recession had ended.</br></br>The pickup in home sales that began in the spring also lost some momentum in the summer, according to people in various Fed districts. The New York Fed reported that one large builder now faces bankruptcy because a loan for a large development was not renewed.</br></br>In a separate sign that consumers aren't yet in a buying mood, the Fed reported yesterday that consumer credit in June registered its largest drop since January, when the start of the Persian Gulf War sent consumers scurrying for cover. The figures showed that credit dropped by 3%, or $1.8 billion, in June. That follows a decline of 2.2%, or $1.3 billion, in May."

When his moment came, Evans asked Livingston whether he could help resolve a dispute between his client, a paint manufacturer, and the Environmental Protection Agency over paint fumes. Evans walked away with the name of Livingston's staff director, James W. ""Will"" Dyer.</br></br>""We might be able to accommodate him with some language,"" Livingston said in an interview later. He meant that he might be able to insert some wording to solve Evans's problem in one of the annual spending bills he controls.</br></br>For Livingston, the encounter was no different from what happens routinely in the hallways and reception rooms of Congress, where he answers supplicants by promising to examine their specific requests for legislative remedies. The significance was the setting.</br></br>Bob Livingston, one of the Hill's consummate inside players, has taken his show on the road. Although he was on the verge of retiring from politics four months ago, the 21-year House veteran has now assembled a national fund-raising drive with the short-term goal of raising money for Republican candidates -- and the long-term goal of propelling himself into the speaker's chair."

"With yesterday's mini-meltdown on Wall Street, the question looms larger than ever: Have the financial markets detached themselves from the ""real"" economy of jobs, incomes and gross domestic product?</br></br>For many economists, the answer is a fairly resounding yes.

"They're antsy and edgy, tired of waiting for promotion opportunities at work as their elders put off retirement.

Oh, and they want work-life balance, too.</br></br>Not necessarily, say people who track the generations. In these hard times, they're also hearing strong rumblings of discontent from Generation X. They're the 32- to 44-year-olds who are wedged between baby boomers and their children, often feeling like forgotten middle siblings -- and increasingly restless at work as a result.</br></br>""All of a sudden, we've gone from being the young upstarts to being the curmudgeons,"" says Bruce Tulgan, a generational consultant who's written books about various age groups, including his fellow Gen Xers.</br></br>This isn't the first time Gen Xers have faced tough times. They came of age during a recession and survived the dot-com bust of 2000.

"Continued strains in the labor market are weighing on Federal Reserve officials more than recent turmoil in Europe, their public comments Thursday suggested.</br></br>Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart indicated that the central bank may raise interest rates even if joblessness remains high.

"The failure of the White House to promote an aggressive economic recovery plan may severely imperil GOP chances of holding on to the House and taking back control of the Senate in 2002. As economist Larry Kudlow points out, we are now officially in a private-sector recession (two straight quarters of no growth in the economy outside of government). A weak economy in 2002 will mean major and potentially catastrophic GOP losses at the polls in the crucial midterm elections.</br></br>Yet ever since the passage of the president's tax cut back in June, the GOP's legislative momentum has slammed nose first into a concrete wall erected by Tom Daschle and Dick Gephardt. Virtually every bill that now is speeding through Congress is a growth depressant. The legislative docket is filled with financially bearish legislation -- to wit, the patients' bill of rights (which will cause a rash of lawsuits and enrich the trial lawyers); the Medicare prescription drug benefit (which could cost taxpayers $300 billion over the next 10 years); the farm bill (which would give away record subsidies to the agri-business industry); and the appropriations bills (that could allow spending to grow by 8% or 9% this year). President Bush should announce that he will veto any or all of these until the economy recovers.</br></br>This is America's first New Economy recession. American investors, of all incomes, have lost an unprecedented $4 to $5 trillion in wealth in the past 18 months. There's no reassuring market signal that these losses will be recouped anytime soon and there's certainly little federal action to revive growth. These enormous wealth losses have not yet punctured consumer confidence or spending, and they have not caused many net job losses. Nor have real estate values taken a hit. Not yet, at least.</br></br>We are surfing uncharted waters. This recession is driven by a drought in investment, not a conventional drought in consumption. High risk capital investment funding -- one of the driving forces behind the powerful expansion of the mid- and late-1990s -- has dried up. Venture capital funding is down more than 50% so far this year and the IPO market is moribund.</br></br>Over the past several weeks, the White House proclamations on the economy by Larry Lindsey and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill have been mostly happy talk about recovery by the end of the year. Let's hope they're right. But what if they're not? Where is the economic and political contingency plan? A pep talk is not enough to rescue the economy from its doldrums. True, many Wall Street economists are also predicting a resumption of growth soon, but they have been totally wrong in predicting the direction of the economy and stock market over the past several years, so their confidence is actually discouraging."
"During last year's campaign, President Obama vowed to enact a bold agenda without raising taxes for the middle class, a pledge budget experts viewed with skepticism. Since then, a severe recession, massive deficits and a national debt that is swelling toward a 50-year high have only made his promise harder to keep.</br></br>The Obama administration has insisted that the pledge will stand. But the president's top economic advisers have refused to rule out broad-based tax increases to close the yawning gap between federal revenue and government spending and are warning of tough choices ahead.</br></br>Republicans are already on the attack, accusing Obama of plotting to break his no-tax vow, the same political transgression that cost Democrats control of Congress under former president Bill Clinton and may have cost president George H.W. Bush his job. Democrats say Obama is highly unlikely to break the pledge before next year's congressional election and observe that it would be safer to wait until his second term if a tax increase becomes unavoidable.</br></br>Some lawmakers are focused instead on setting up an independent commission to solve the deficit problem. Senate Budget Committee chairman Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) plans to hold hearings on the topic when Congress returns to Washington this fall.</br></br>Obama, meanwhile, has vowed to pay for any new initiatives and to draft an overhaul of the health-care system that eventually would save the government money, driving deficits down. But effective health reforms would take decades to produce savings. In the meantime, White House budget director Peter R. Orszag acknowledged, ""there are additional steps that will be necessary."" ""The administration is very concerned about these [future] deficits, and getting those deficits under control is a top priority of the administration,"" Orszag told reporters this week as he rolled out a new economic forecast that added $2 trillion to deficit projections from 2010 to 2019."
"The new figures on unemployment strongly suggest that the time has come for more drastic-measures to reshape and reinvigorate the national productive effort. Conferences among top Administration officials at the White House indicate that some such measures are being formulated. But if there is to be a genuine rebirth of confidence, without which the slump cannot be arrested, whatever program is being formulated must have some real substance. Mere restatements of the presidential optimism, it is now plain, will not suffice.</br></br>At the same time, it needs to be kept constantly in mind that powerful forces of expansion are still present which, unrestrained, could again lead, quickly to unacceptable inflation. The capacity to build homes, for example, and the need for more housing are as strong as ever and will grow stronger in the decade ahead. The same is true in many other fields. What is required is just enough new incentive to get the ball rolling; what is to be avoided is a slam-bang, crash program that would in a short time require .severe hew restraints to prevent a price runaway.</br></br>If a tax cut should become necessary to trigger a resumption of growth, most assuredly it should contain an automatic repeal provision. Federal spending needs to be increased by several billions annually if urgent defense and domestic needs are to be met. An increase in the 1959 budget goals would also have a considerable tonic effect on the economy. If, later on, it appeared that higher spending was having an inflationary effect, the budget could be restored to balance by a tax increase. For this year and perhaps for the next, however, a deficit would certainly be no cause for alarm.</br></br>As for monetary controls, the Federal Reserve Board ought to encourage further cuts in the rediscount rate at once. Very soon it should case bank reserve requirements if the situation does not improve. These actions arc easily reversible. The very fact that the financial community knows this‰ÛÓand knows that reversal would come swiftly if required‰ÛÓmeans that fairly vigorous actions to case credit restraint are required to induce an actual credit expansion. The two cuts in' the ‰ÛÏFed‰Û rediscount rate made since the current recession began last fall have not been strong enough medicine.</br></br>An immediate and determined Administration drive for long-term renewal of the Trade Agreements Act and for a real expansion of foreign economic development aid also would have a useful effect in restoring confidence. The slump in exports is serious and cannot be altogclhcr offsel by any foreseeable expansion of Government or private spending in this country. If the Nation does not act to insure a steadily growing market for its goods overseas, it will inevitably and critically stunt its economic growth. Significantly, those countries which in recent years have outstripped the rate of American economic growth have been nations which, like Germany, the Netherlands and Japan, have been pushing foreign trade to the hilt."
"Until his retirement last month, Thomas Hoenig was a consistent thorn in Ben Bernanke's side, voting against the Federal Reserve chairman's easy-money policies at each of the central bank's eight policy-making meetings in 2010.</br></br>Now, Mr. Hoenig, the former Kansas City Fed president, is likely to become a thorn for the nation's biggest banks.</br></br>In a rare display of bipartisanship, the Senate appears likely to easily confirm Mr. Hoenig to a six-year term as the vice chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., an agency that gained significant powers over the nation's biggest banks under last year's Dodd-Frank financial overhaul. Mr. Hoenig breezed through his confirmation hearing Thursday, lauded by senators from both parties.</br></br>The choice has rattled Wall Street executives. Mr. Hoenig believes some banks are so big that they are a risk to the financial system, and that taxpayers might need to bail them out in the future, just as they rescued big financial firms in the 2008 crisis.</br></br>Mr. Hoenig believes there is only one way to end this phenomenon of ""too big to fail."" ""We must break up the largest banks,"" he said in a February speech, arguing that regulators could do so by restricting the activities of government-backed banks ""and significantly narrowing the scope of institutions that are now more powerful and more of a threat to our capitalistic system than prior to the crisis."""
"Alice Rivlin, head of the District of Columbia's control board, thought the Woman's National Democratic Club invited her to lunch last week to make a Women's History Month speech.</br></br>To her surprise, she was not only a speaker--but also the topic of speeches by Mayor Anthony Williams; U.S. Treasurer Mary Ellen Withrow; Jack Lew, director of the Office of Management and Budget; and Robert Litan, Brookings Institution vice president. WNDC President Anna Stout introduced them all.</br></br>They had gathered to honor Rivlin with the WNDC's Democratic Woman of the Year Award. The praise was high for her distinguished public service. Besides heading the control board, she has served as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and director of the Office of Management and Budget, and was the founding director of the Congressional Budget Office.</br></br>Williams, speaking mostly off the cuff, said, ""Alice and I have a unique relationship. I'm trying to put her out of business at the control board and she's trying to help me. In her previous life, she helped balance the books for our entire country.

"RIO DE JANEIRO -- Last May, in the northern mining town of Carajas, a jubilant President Jose Sarney met with his top economists to discuss the anti-inflation Cruzado Plan. Launched two months before, the ""Plan"" had slashed inflation by freezing prices and wages. It had also sparked national enthusiasm, transforming President Sarney from has-been to hero. However, government economist Edmar Bacha, a Brazilian trained at Yale and an architect of the Plan, was worried.</br></br>He wasn't the only one. ""We went to Carajas convinced we'd go down the drain if we did not make serious adjustments,"" says Andre Lara Resende, another of the U.S.-trained economists behind the Plan. He and Mr. Bacha warned the president the price freeze was provoking overheated demand and repressed inflation.</br></br>Mr. Bacha recalls the president's response: ""You make this sound like a torture chamber. You don't realize you've performed a miracle and created a social revolution.""</br></br>The divisions that emerged in Carajas have since evolved dramatically, culminating in this week's resignation of Central Bank President Fernao Bracher and his top director, Persio Arida. For months Mr. Bracher's warnings about the dangers of repressed inflation had also been discounted. As a result, Brazil, once again, is on the brink of hyperinflation. The cruzado, a symbol of hope when it was created by lopping three zeros off the cruzeiro, is losing value almost as fast as the former currency was when Mr. Sarney announced the Plan on Feb. 28 last year. Inflation then was 15%, or an annualized rate of more than 400%: It's about that now. Interest rates have soared more than 600% on expectations of high inflation. And commerce has slowed as industrialists await signs of the government's intentions.</br></br>A close look at what went wrong illustrates how a policy designed to beat inflation was twisted into an electoral platform and a nebulous program of social reform. It suggests that Brazil -- which is beginning talks on rescheduling its $108 billion foreign debt -- is heading into an economic crisis that could lead to mounting calls for unilateral debt action. Quite simply, post-cruzado Brazil is drugged with illusions and drained of resources."
"Only a month ago, analysts were warning that the French franc was heading into another crisis.</br></br>The currency was weakening, unions were threatening a wave of strikes and the government's still-undisclosed 1997 budget was being dismissed as unrealistic.</br></br>Now, two days before the government formally unveils its budget, the blistering attack on the franc is nowhere in sight. Moreover, most analysts now say it probably won't ever come. The mark ended European trading Friday at 3.4115 francs, down sharply from highs a week earlier of around 3.43 francs.</br></br>""It's all over,"" says Graham McDevitt, senior bond strategist with Paribas Capital Markets in London and one of those who had been betting on a brutal autumn.</br></br>To be sure, foreign-exchange-market sentiment can swing just as abruptly in the other direction. Were the U.S. dollar to suddenly weaken, the franc could fall against the mark, analysts say. Or a unilateral slowdown in the French economy could result in fiscal holes that are just too big for markets -- and politicians -- to ignore."
"The ""surprise"" jump in producer and consumer price inflation is not a surprise when you understand the political and economic logic of using one nation's domestic currency -- the U.S. dollar -- as international money. Domestically oriented analysts have been fooled because U.S. inflation responds to the world-wide supply of dollars, not just those in the U.S.</br></br>The Bush administration fervently hopes the latest figures are just an aberration. Such arguments must be used with caution. (The Carter administration used to tell us that if you took away food, energy and housing, the underlying rate of inflation was only 9%.) True, the price of crude oil jumped more than $5 a barrel from November to January. But analysts knew what oil prices were, and they were still surprised. Moreover, oil prices fell sharply for most of 1988 without a fall in the inflation rate. Everything points to a broader acceleration of inflation.</br></br>While some point to rising wages or energy costs, the main cause of the current inflation is the past expansion of what my forecasting firm calls the ""world dollar base"" -- the stock of high-powered money (currency plus bank reserves) in the U.S., plus the dollars held by foreign central banks. The world dollar base is key because the world operates on a kind of ""dollar standard."" Other currencies are no longer pegged to the dollar. But most currencies, including the Japanese yen and West German mark, are backed with dollars, as currencies once were backed by gold reserves. The dollar shared this role with gold under the Bretton Woods monetary system of 1944-71. But since 1971, the dollar has been the unchallenged ""reserve currency,"" even with somewhat greater use of the yen and the mark by small countries.</br></br>This change had an important, but overlooked, consequence for the U.S. ""twin deficits"": budget and trade. Under the dollar standard -- as under a gold standard -- the rest of the world must consume and invest less than its income in order to acquire reserves (sought for reasons I shall note). In economic jargon, this is called running an overall ""balance-of-payments surplus."" It's analogous to the fact that to put more cash in your wallet, you must pay out less than you earn, beg or borrow.</br></br>But it's different for the reserve-currency country. If other countries increase their dollar reserves, the U.S. must pay out more than it receives -- run a chronic ""balance-of-payments deficit."" To get a rough idea of the difference, imagine that everyone carried your personal checks around in his wallet instead of money. You wouldn't need to carry any cash -- just your checkbook. And with so many of your checks floating around permanently uncashed, you would always have a fat checking-account balance at your disposal, far beyond what you had saved."
"When stocks collapsed in a free fall last May, the fear was that the market had been taken over by high-speed computers that had run amok.</br></br>A year after the ""flash crash,"" which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunge 600 points in less than 10 minutes, the stock market is a much quieter place.</br></br>Companies that use fast-trading, computer-driven strategies, which were painted by some as culprits of the collapse, have curtailed trading. So, too, have many long-term investors, for whom the trauma of that May 6 afternoon was the final straw after a decade of stock-market turmoil. In their absence, trading volume and volatility have plunged, further deterring high-frequency traders.</br></br>High-frequency strategies ""have less to work with, so they don't participate, which creates less volume,"" said Will Mechem, a managing partner at high-frequency trading firm Pan Alpha Trading. ""This would seem to be a vicious cycle.""</br></br>In the first four months of this year, average daily trading volume of stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market is down 15% from 2010's pace, running at an average rate of 6.3 billion shares a day.

"NEW YORK -- Retail issues faltered, joining high technology as a source of pressure on fading market averages.</br></br>Shares of Talbots dropped $6.95 to $46.80 each, while AnnTaylor Stores fell 1.31 to 26.39 a share and Abercrombie & Fitch declined 1.29 to 29.86 a share.

"While President Bush has been on the road trying to woo public support for his plan to privatize Social Security, two of the nation's economic gurus have been warning that the country is flirting with financial disaster. It's time for the president to stop focusing on a risky and unpopular scheme for addressing the problems of 2040 and to pay more attention to crises that could unfold during the next few years.</br></br>The difficulties with Bush's plan for private investment accounts have become clear: First, it wouldn't address the solvency of the Social Security system, which Bush rightly warns is a serious problem, and it might actually make that problem worse; and, second, it's unpopular with the folks who just reelected Bush. A Washington Post-ABC News poll released Monday showed that only 35 percent of Americans say they approve of Bush's handling of the issue.</br></br>What's truly unfortunate about Bush's privatization road show is that it has distracted him and the nation from the financial threats that loom just over the horizon. Those dangers were highlighted in frightening analyses made this month by investor Warren Buffett and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Though the two differ about precisely what may lie ahead, they agree that unless the United States puts its financial house in order, it faces real trouble.</br></br>Buffett's comments came in his annual letter to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., released March 5. Every year, Buffett's letter offers blunt economic analysis, and it has become a kind of cult object for his devotees. But this year's version was enough to give you indigestion after devouring the sage's favorite meal of a T- bone steak and double hash browns at Gorat's in Omaha. Indeed, it was downright scary in its comments about the dangers posed by America's trade deficit.</br></br>Buffett has argued since 2003 that this huge trade deficit will eventually bring a sharp decline in the dollar, and he has tried to protect his company's shareholders against that dollar crash by speculating in foreign currencies. But this year, with the trade deficit having ballooned to a record $618 billion in 2004, Buffett's tone is almost apocalyptic."
"Charities and nonprofit agencies are hoping for an end-of-year surge in giving to mirror the recent increase in consumer spending and help compensate for a difficult 2009, according to charity officials.</br></br>""This is basically the most critical giving season since the Great Depression,"" said Glen O'Gilvie of the Center for Nonprofit Advancement. ""This will be the litmus test, to see whether the nonprofit sector is coming out of this, remaining stable or getting worse. Every trickle, every sign of growth is helpful in that.""</br></br>Officials at some groups report that they are doing better than expected; others said they have not seen the increase they hoped for. Final numbers will not be available until next month.</br></br>The poor economy forced cuts in funding to nonprofit groups from all sides in 2009; at the same time, it left more families in need of help. Demand for emergency aid, such as food and shelter, surged. Northern Virginia Family Service, for example, had a 30 percent increase in requests for help with housing and a more than 50 percent increase in requests for health care in the past 18 months.</br></br>Many nonprofit groups are counting on individual donors to help make up what they lost in contributions from businesses, governments and foundations this year."
"Author: Neil Shah</br></br>NEW YORK--The euro drifted higher against the dollar after sliding sharply in European trading, as the currency surmounted worries about the European Central Bank's inflation-fighting acumen and the region's debt woes.</br></br>German central bank chief Axel Weber's decision to no longer seek the presidency of the European Central Bank sparked fears that the ECB's next leader may lack a strong stance against rising price pressures. Central banks raise key interest rates to cool off inflation, and higher rates can push a currency's value higher.</br></br>But traders shrugged off their fears, along with comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke acknowledging the U.S. central bank might end its $600 billion bond-buying program before its expected end in June. Mr. Bernanke's comments briefly boosted the dollar against the euro.</br></br>After dipping to $1.3610, the euro climbed to a high of $1.3745 before easing off. Interest rates on U.S. Treasury bonds dipped after a strong sale of U.S. government debt, pushing the euro higher against the dollar.

"Americans are earning more money -- but socking it away and not spending, undermining hopes for a consumer-driven rebound.</br></br>The personal saving rate, which measures savings as a percentage of disposable income, jumped to 4.4% in June from 4% a month earlier and a recent low of 3.2% in November, the government said Tuesday, as consumers squirreled away cash amid the weak economy.</br></br>Spending on everything from vacations to clothes was largely flat in June. Spending fell less than 0.1%, after easing 0.1% in May, even though Americans' income after taxes rose 0.4%, the most since March. Consumer spending is the biggest single driver of the U.S. economy, accounting for roughly two-thirds of demand.</br></br>The pickup in saving is a two-edged sword for the economy. In the long run, saving helps Americans establish a cushion against financial setbacks and build up wealth that can fuel spending. It also helps them cope with rising gasoline and food prices. But penny-pinching sucks life out of the economy, which relies heavily on consumer spending and faces a dimming outlook as other drivers of growth lose steam.</br></br>""This is good news for the future, but it provides little help to the U.S. economy,"" said Eugenio Aleman, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities. ""Individuals are hoarding cash to continue to build a protective layer in case the economy and their personal situation turns negative."""
"WASHINGTON -- President Bush shrugged off concerns about stock- market turmoil, saying Wall Street is adjusting to a flood of liquidity and is beginning to ""readjust its assessment of risk.""</br></br>Mr. Bush, seeking to reassure jittery investors who have watched the market gyrate wildly, said the volatility is natural but the economy is strong and there is enough liquidity to absorb the ups and downs.</br></br>""If markets are given a chance, they will adjust in a way that is a necessary reaction to a flood of liquidity that came into the market over the last couple of years,"" the president said during a briefing with reporters at the Treasury Department.</br></br>Investors have been spooked as they try to discern whether a shakeout in the market for risky mortgages will lead to credit tightening throughout the economy. The flood of credit to which Mr. Bush was referring fueled a boom on Wall Street, providing loans for homeowners, including some with poor finances, and sparking a wave of corporate takeovers financed with debt. There is concern that a tightening in lending standards could hurt the broader economy.</br></br>Asked whether he was concerned that the shakeout could spread, Mr. Bush said it ""all depends on if you're a glass-half-full or a glass- half-empty kind of guy."" He said the U.S. economy is strong and that Wall Street will ""look at the fundamentals of the economy,"" such as low unemployment and low inflation. He added that the correction in the housing market appeared to be heading for a ""soft landing."""
"There is no quick fix for the Tokyo stock market, Japanese and U.S. money managers say. Despite a small recovery last week, they predict the Tokyo market will fall further before it hits bottom.

"MEMBERS OF Congress, who set their own pay, are caught between weaknesses. They want-and, we think, are entitled to-higher pay than they have the courage to vote for. Their way of choosing between the unpleasant alternatives over the years has been not to choose but to resort to subterfuge. The slipperiness of the system has become worse than the reality it is meant to hide.</br></br>The latest example has to do with a vote that Congress took in 1954 to forgive itself some taxes. It adopted a provision, still in effect, allowing each member to deduct as business expenses up to $3,000 a year of living expenses here in Washington. Inflation, of course, has greatly eroded the value of the deduction. In the House Ways and Means Committee, which is considering a bill to make ""technical corrections"" to the code, proposals have been made to lift and even remove the ceiling on the deductible amount.</br></br>The rationale for the 1954 provision is that it merely puts members of Congress on the same footing as all other taxpayers, who are allowed to deduct uncompensated travel, lodging and other such expenses when away from home on business. The congressmen are also said to be away from ""home,"" by which is meant their districts.</br></br>The trouble is that Washington is in fact where most members principally live. Business trips for them are the trips they regularly take back to their districts. The reason they don't want to make these deductible is that they've already given themselves allowances to cover most of the cost. The allowances are legitimate, but would make a deduction less valuable; it would be redundant.</br></br>A deduction for living costs in Washington has no such disadvantage. It is pure lamb chop; it puts congressmen on a very different footing from all other taxpayers. They can deduct things-the cost of everyday housing, food, the car-that the average citizen cannot."
"Republican Fairfax Supervisor Thomas M. Davis III has raised more than twice as much money as Democratic County Board Chairman Audrey Moore, but has little left in the bank as their campaign for Northern Virginia's most visible local office swings into its final month.</br></br>According to campaign finance reports filed yesterday, Davis collected $65,768 during September, bringing his total to $350,449, while Moore pulled in $39,388 during the same period, for a total of $156,650.</br></br>By spending less on consultants, pollsters and other campaign tools, Moore has squirreled away $47,355, while Davis has just $8,317 on hand.</br></br>The high-profile chairman's race has dwarfed every other contest in Northern Virginia in terms of big-bucks fund-raising. But it remains uncertain whether the two campaigns will be able to match the record-setting $1 million spending of the watershed 1987 election that swept Moore into office.</br></br>Strategists in both camps insisted they will raise what they need to win, but with just five weeks until the Nov. 5 election, ensuring money for television advertising has become a critical focus for Moore and Davis.

The budget was formally presented to School Board members at last night's board meeting.</br></br>Although next year's proposed budget, at $133.5 million, is larger than the current budget by 4.3 percent, Gosling said that increase will not make up the erosion caused by inflation and cost-of-living adjustments. In all, Gosling said, $4.3 million in programs will have to be trimmed from next year's budget.</br></br>Teacher layoffs will be averted in the coming year, and the elimination of 55 staff positions, mostly by attrition, will result in savings of about $1.3 million, Gosling said. He said that class size in Arlington schools will grow by an average of one student per class.</br></br>Funds for the school capital improvement program, approved by voters in a November bond referendum, will not be affected by the budget cuts, Gosling said."
"As holiday shoppers shift into high gear, finding the fastest computer has gotten a little more confusing.</br></br>It used to be simple. All you had to do was compare three numbers - - the processor speed listed on the box, the price listed on the tag and the balance in your bank account -- and purchase accordingly.</br></br>Now, however, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices is arguing that one of those figures is misleading. While many of us look at a system's processor speed measured in megahertz (or, more recently, gigahertz) first and foremost, Sunnyvale, Calif.-based AMD says that number doesn't tell the full story.</br></br>The controversy started with Intel's new Pentium 4 processors, which top out at a faster clock rate than the latest AMD Athlon XP processors. Intel's fastest Pentium 4 runs at 2 GHz, while the Athlon XP maxes out at 1.6 GHz.</br></br>But the Pentium 4 uses a new architecture that, analysts say, works less efficiently than that of its predecessor. So even though the Pentium 4 runs at a faster clock rate, it's getting slightly less done per clock tick than an AMD chip with the same clock speed -- or even a Pentium III with the same clock speed."

""Although a single month's reading is inconclusive, the decline in confidence is too large and widespread to be dismissed as merely a technical aberration.

"And at Rep. Ron Paul, the 2008 presidential candidate who had the zany idea -- as many laughing people thought -- that the Federal Reserve system could become a sizzling political issue. Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Fed, who does not laugh promiscuously, knows that it is no laughing matter that Paul has 317 co-sponsors (180 Republicans, 137 Democrats) for a bill to open the Fed's books to ""audit"" by the comptroller general.</br></br>The canny congressman cannot accomplish what the title of his best-selling book recommends: ""End the Fed."" But he probably hopes that if the Fed's transactions with financial institutions were publicized, he and kindred spirits could stir populist resentment of the mysterious institution. Although profoundly mistaken in his objective -- breaking the Fed to Congress's saddle -- Paul is not frivolous. His rage against the Fed is rooted in his rejection of fiat money -- paper money backed by nothing but confidence in Congress (really), and his libertarian enthusiasm for maximizing the role of unmanaged markets in allocating social rewards.</br></br>Bernanke on Monday told the Economic Club of Washington that Congress already can examine the Fed's balance sheet. His worry is that Congress, by ordering audits when it dislikes Fed monetary policy decisions, might make the Fed seem subject to, and eventually actually make it subject to, congressional pressure.</br></br>At Bernanke's recent confirmation hearing on his nomination for a second four-year term, Jim DeMint, a South Carolina Republican who is co-sponsoring a Senate version of Paul's bill, asked Bernanke: ""Do you believe that employment should be a mission, a goal of the Federal Reserve?"" Bernanke, who had already noted Congress's ""mandate"" that the Fed ""achieve maximum employment and price stability,"" answered that the Fed ""can assist keeping employment close to its maximum level through adroit policies.""</br></br>That mandate was, however, improvidently given. Congress created the Fed and can control it, and eventually will do so if the Fed eagerly embraces the role of the economy's comprehensive manager. America's complex, dynamic economy cannot be both ""managed"" and efficient. Attempting to manage it is an inherently political undertaking, and if the Fed undertakes it, the Fed will eventually bring upon itself minute supervision by Congress."

"WASHINGTON -- Retail sales jumped a surprising 1.4% in February, the Commerce Department said.</br></br>The big increase suggests consumer spending continues to be strong in spite of signs of weakness among the nation's manufacturing industries.

"Consumer spending has stalled along with the economic recovery, new data show, muting expectations for the critical holiday shopping season.</br></br>The Commerce Department reported Friday that spending rose a modest 0.2 percent in August from the previous month when adjusted for inflation - well below last year's August gains. In addition, economists say the increase was boosted by the federal government's temporary extension of unemployment benefits, which also padded incomes and savings.</br></br>The feeble appetite of shoppers is one of several factors holding back the economic recovery. The stubborn unemployment rate and continued fallout in home prices have not only taken their own toll on the nation's financial health, but they also have consumers cautious, keeping their wallets in their pockets.</br></br>A monthly survey by the University of Michigan/Reuters that was released Friday showed consumer sentiment dipped in September, dropping seven-tenths of a point on the index to 68.2.

And with the market off 5.92% last week, and despite yesterday's 96 point recovery, a lot of earthbound traders are getting aggrieved that Alan Greenspan hadn't pulled the interest-rate cord for them earlier. Now they're worried it's ""too late,"" that inflation is loose and they're headed for a fall.</br></br>It's not overwhelmingly clear to us that inflation's back. Maybe the wholesale price jump was only a blip. But bond traders, like canaries in a coal mine, are worth watching. There are enough worrisome signs around that this is a good moment to start thinking seriously about what's beyond the economic horizon for the U.S. economy. Robert Mundell, the supply-side economist who just won the Nobel Prize, already has the near term in mind. Interviewed last week he said, ""I don't see any indication of a slowdown in the U.S. economy in the present, but I would not be surprised if that occurred next year.""</br></br>Now when we say serious thinking about the near term, that includes Presidential candidates who will be running full tilt next year. What if inflation indeed shows up and the Fed feels impelled to tighten, even at risk of a downturn during the election campaign? If the person heading for the White House inherits a stalling U.S. economy, voters will want an answer. The answer isn't, ""I plan to stay within the spending caps."" That's a Beltway thing; it's not an economic strategy.</br></br>A real economic strategy is aimed at boosting the real economy, whose state of health is anticipated by stock and bond markets. In this world, what one watches are prices, which direct goods and investments to their most productive uses. Inflation disincentivizes that process, and the concern of late is that some relevant prices have been blipping upward.</br></br>The price of oil, for instance, has more than doubled the past 12 months, owing in great part to the oil-producing nations' ability this time to hang together on prices. They're helped by a number of factors, such as the participation of Mexico. But OPEC's success can also be read as a sign of accommodative monetary policies."
"NEW YORK, March 14 (AP)‰ÛÓThe amazing 1964 stock' market rise strung out its list of weekly advances to six straight this week.	---------------------</br></br>But the advance, again, was irregular. As profits were taken on previously strong groups, other sections of the list moved in to the spotlight.</br></br>‰Û¢Analysts who.expected the market to sell off when the Dow-Jones Industrial average reached the ‰ÛÏmagic‰Û 800 level] saw the indicator rise 10.19 this week to a new closing peak of 816.22.</br></br>It was a substantial gain but the over-all market showed only a moderate margin of gainers over losers, the score being 778 to 562 among the 1509 issues traded.</br></br>Volume swelled to 28,204,421 shares from 26,048,470 the previous week.

"Lockheed Martin Corp. has reached a tentative contract agreement with workers at two of three factories that had threatened to strike, but the local union at the company's plant in Marietta, Ga., recommended rejecting the settlement offer.</br></br>Union officials at two plants in California -- an airplane development center in Palmdale and a missiles and space facility in Sunnyvale -- have expressed support for the package. The company's final offer was announced yesterday after nearly 36 hours of negotiations with the aid of federal mediators.</br></br>Members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers at all three of the plants are to vote on the offer Sunday. Earlier this week, about 6,000 of the workers voted to strike on Monday if there was no agreement.</br></br>Strikes now appear unlikely in California, but Jim Carroll, president of the union's Local 709 in Marietta, said the contract for the Georgia workers contains different language. Among other concerns, Carroll said the proposed contract would let Lockheed Martin outsource work now being done by employees.</br></br>Outsourcing and job security have been particular concerns in Marietta, where the company builds the F-22 fighter jet and the C- 130J military transport -- aircraft with relatively high price tags and low production runs. The local union's membership has dropped from 7,000 workers in 1990 to about 2,700 now."
"Barack Obama is asking Americans to gamble that the U.S. economy can be taxed into prosperity. That's the message of his campaign for the Buffett Rule, which raises income-tax rates on millionaires to a minimum of 30%, and for the expiration of the Bush tax cuts. He wants to raise the highest income tax rate by 20%, double the rate on capital gains, add a new 3.8% tax on all capital earnings, and nearly triple the dividend tax rate.</br></br>All this will enhance ""economic efficiency,"" insists a White House economic report. As for those who disagree, says President Obama, they're just pushing ""the same version of trickle-down economics tried for much of the last century. . . . But prosperity sure didn't trickle down.""</br></br>Mr. Obama needs a refresher course on the 1920s, 1960s, 1980s and even the 1990s, when government spending and taxes fell and employment and incomes grew rapidly.</br></br>But if the president wants to see fresher evidence of how taxes matter, he can look to what's happening in the 50 states. In our new report ""Rich States, Poor States,"" prepared for the American Legislative Exchange Council, we compare the economic performance of states with no income tax to that of states with high rates. It's like comparing Hong Kong with Greece or King Kong with fleas.</br></br>Every year for the past 40, the states without income taxes had faster output growth (measured on a decadal basis) than the states with the highest income taxes. In 1980, for example, there were 10 zero-income-tax states. Over the decade leading up to 1980, those states grew 32.3 percentage points faster than the 10 states with the highest tax rates. Job growth was also much higher in the zero-tax states. The states with the nine highest income tax rates had no net job growth at all, and seven of those nine managed to lose jobs."
"Prince George's Community College President Ronald A. Williams has a simple message for this year's candidates in the race for county executive: Help!</br></br>In a letter sent to the contenders, Williams, starting his fourth year at the helm of the 36,000-student college, appealed for increased financial support after the election.</br></br>In case the candidates had any doubts about the college's needs, Williams detailed ""four funding initiatives for the 2002 political campaign platform."" ""One of the things that struck me as the campaign has gone along is that even though education is central to what every candidate sees as important, I don't think the community college has had a sufficiently high profile in that conversation,"" Williams said in an interview. ""I have a concern about the minimalist approach the county has taken for 40 years in providing resources for the college.""</br></br>It's all about money. But it's also about the increasing role the college has come to play in the life of the county, with more than 47 percent of college-bound Prince George's students enrolling there. Since Williams's arrival in 1999, enrollment has risen 8 percent.</br></br>At the same time, county funds account for 22 percent of the college's operating budget, down from 27 percent six years ago. That's ""the lowest level of local aid to a community college in the state,"" Williams wrote."
"NEW YORK, Sept. 21 (APf‰ÛÓThe stock market this week edged to another historic high amid continuing cross currents. It was the third straight week that the list has achieved new peaks, and the eighth straight week</br></br>The market was still chewing away at resistance in the form of large blocks of stock put up for sale by long-term holders. Analysts noted, with some concern, that the advance of the averages was due to the performance of relatively few stocks.</br></br>The Dow-Jones average of 30 industrials this week advanced 3.47 to end the week at a historic closing record of 743.60.</br></br>The Associated Press average of 6U stocks rose 1.0 to 231.5‰ÛÓa historic high that was first reached Thursday.

"WASHINGTON--The number of new applications for jobless benefits rose last week to the highest level since June, but stayed near prerecession lows.</br></br>Initial claims for unemployment benefits increased by 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 315,000 in the week ended Sept. 6, the Labor Department said Thursday. Claims for the previous week were revised higher to 304,000.</br></br>Last week's claims level was well above the 300,000 forecast by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal, though it was possibly distorted by the Labor Day holiday. A Labor Department analyst noted that claims, a proxy for layoffs, tend to be especially volatile around holidays.</br></br>The four-week moving average of claims, which smooths out weekly volatility, was up 750 to 304,000. It has been trending higher since hitting a 2014 low of 293,750 in early August. But that is still well below the average for the first half of the year and remains at levels last consistently seen before the recession.</br></br>""The claims data show clear improvement in labor-market conditions over the past few months, but some modest deterioration over the most recent few weeks,"" said J.P. Morgan Chase economist Daniel Silver."
"1 The Senate District Commit* tee swiftly approved 11 bills yesterday, including one to liberalize unemployment benefit pay in the District.</br></br>In another action, the Committee virtually killed a House-passed bill that would exempt Capitol employes from buying District auto tags.

It was opposed by District officials.</br></br>I sat ion bill would increase the [maximum weekly benefit from $30 to $54 and provide a maximum of 26 weeks pay to all eligible persons.</br></br>The committee changed the bill to keep a requirement of 5 the present law: that copies of benefit check stubs must be sent to the unemployed person‰Ûªs last employer."

"WASHINGTON--A gauge of U.S. inflation ticked lower last month, a sign that price pressures remain tame amid subdued economic growth and one that could ease concern from central bankers.</br></br>The producer-price index for final demand, which measures changes in the prices firms receive for their goods and services, fell a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in May from a month earlier, the Labor Department said Friday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a 0.2% rise in prices. Producer prices were up 2% from a year ago.</br></br>May's report showed inflationary pressures abruptly falling off after building in March and April. May prices for food, energy and the trade services all fell from the prior month. A gauge that excludes these volatile components was unchanged, an indication of broad-based weakness in prices.</br></br>Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Sterne Agee, said the data should ""ease concerns"" among some Federal Reserve officials that inflation was gathering steam. ""A potential catalyst for a change in monetary policy, inflationary pressures reported in April, appear to be short-lived,"" Ms. Piegza said.</br></br>Other economists cautioned against reading too much into one month of data from a report that has been giving volatile readings since its methodology was changed in January. Cooper Howes, economist at Barclays, said the producer-price index is likely ""taking pause after moving steadily higher in recent months. We expect it to gradually trend upward."""
"Stock prices rebounded modestly from Wednesday's steep slide, but bond prices continued to fall, prompting concern about high long-term interest rates. The dollar rose against European currencies and was unchanged against the yen.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 19.90 to 3244.86 in active trading. Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index rose 1.28 to 411.62. But the Nasdaq Composite Index added a tidy 5.06 to 621.37.</br></br>Yesterday's gains came after a dose of high interest rates Wednesday knocked the Dow Jones industrials for a 47-point loss. The rebound squelched budding fears that Wednesday's sell-off might herald the beginning of a more serious correction.</br></br>But some analysts warned that long-term interest rates are getting dangerously high. As the prices of long-term Treasury bonds have eroded during the past month the yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30year bond has risen to 7.78% from 7.39%. A yield of 7.8%, some analysts suggest, may be enough to divert investors away from stocks' uncertain prospects of eventually fatter corporate profits and direct them back to bonds as a competitive investment.</br></br>Bond prices slipped yesterday amid confusion about the Treasury's intentions for financing the federal debt. Yesterday, Budget Director Richard Darman told a congressional committee that the administration's budget proposal assumes that the Treasury will place less emphasis on the 30-year bond as a financing instrument than in the past. But he later was quoted as saying that a decision hasn't been made on the amount of 30-year bonds to be sold at next month's refunding auction."
"NEW YORK -- Average interest rates at a big weekly auction of commercial paper fell for the third straight week, suggesting that short-term corporate borrowing costs are on the decline.</br></br>The average interest rate at Citicorp's $50 million auction of 91-day commercial paper, or corporate IOUs, dropped to 9.3159% from 9.595% at last week's sale.</br></br>As recently as late March, Citicorp sold 91-day paper with an average payout slightly over 10%.</br></br>Bids totaling $448 million were submitted. Accepted bids ranged from 9.302% to 9.325%.</br></br>Citicorp also said that the average rate at its $50 million auction of 182-day commercial paper fell to 9.115% from 9.423% at last week's sale."
"According to the latest mutual-fund returns, the U.S. has been surpassed by the rest of the world, and portfolio managers say that trend could continue.</br></br>International-stock mutual funds are up an average 17% this year through Friday. Despite the recent record-shattering move by the Nasdaq Composite Index, the average U.S. diversified stock fund lags behind its foreign counterpart with a 13% return through Friday, according to fund-tracker Lipper Inc.</br></br>There could be more of the same in the coming months. ""I think international markets will continue to outperform"" the U.S. stock market, but perhaps not the tech-heavy Nasdaq index, said Irene Cheng, lead manager of Scudder International Fund.</br></br>Ms. Cheng's assertion stems from her belief Japan is ""dead serious"" about turning around its economy. David Lui, who manages Strong International Stock Fund, agrees. A number of secular trends in Japan bode well for a lasting economic recovery, he says. Companies in Japan are restructuring, instituting layoffs and selling unprofitable divisions, moves they hadn't undertaken before. In addition, Mr. Lui says, ""individual investors in Japan are tiptoeing back into the market after they got so badly burned in the early 1990s, and that's a very bullish signal.""</br></br>A year ago, Japan's markets were starting to dig out from a devastating financial crisis. Meanwhile, European markets were thriving, in part because of optimism over the European Union's unified economy and the then-coming euro monetary unit. This year, things have reversed; Japan has performed well, while Europe seems to have been a victim of its own success. But don't count the Continent out yet, managers say, there is room for improvement."

"Copper futures prices were firm again on indications of an improved economy and prospective demand for the metal.</br></br>May delivery copper rose 2.75 cents a pound to $1.06, for a two-day gain of 5.5 cents. The market ignored an increase of 684 tons in warehouse stocks of New York's Commodity Exchange to 11,529 tons.</br></br>""There's a generally more positive attitude toward the economy,"" said Bette Raptapoulos, analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York. ""You have the more than 20% increase in new home sales in February and the housing market is a key user of copper.""</br></br>William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures, New York, observed that while trading lacked distinction, the premium commanded by the May futures contract over more distant months was a key indicator of the strength in the market.</br></br>""One spread that traders are closely watching is the May-December,"" he said. The premium of May over December rose 0.75 cent a pound to 15.8 cents, he said, which indicates ""concern during forthcoming months about supplies of copper to meet demand."""

Ways and Means Chairman Wilbur D. Mills (D-Ark.) has pledged that a bill will be sent to the House floor before the Aug. 13 recess."
"The Federal Reserve's decision to continue one of the most audacious experiments in monetary history -- an $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program designed to boost growth -- followed six months of tense negotiations inside the central bank, and a stumbling effort to let the public know what was going on.</br></br>A small group of Fed officials has been privately pushing Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke to plan an exit from his signature program, said several people familiar with the closed-door deliberations. But glimmers of a weakening economy prompted the Fed in September to keep the program going -- surprising markets primed by months of central-bank suggestions that a wind-down was nearing.</br></br>The saga shows how hard it is for a central bank to communicate about plans that are complicated, evolving and conditional on the economy. Fed officials regard programs designed to sway long-term interest rates as essential to the fragile economy -- tools for stimulating consumer spending, investing and home buying. Mr. Bernanke has long argued that being more transparent will make such policies more effective.</br></br>The Fed's efforts to telegraph its strategy left investors confused at key points about where it was heading, and some misread Mr. Bernanke's intentions about the bond-buying program and interest rates. That disconnect exacerbated a real-world problem: rising rates that by August showed signs of denting a budding housing recovery.</br></br>At present, the Fed has laid the groundwork to start reducing its bond purchases later this year or early next year. But that depends on how the economy weathers another recent soft patch, which has been complicated by feuding between Congress and the White House over fiscal policy. More clues will appear Wednesday when the Fed releases minutes of its Sept. 17-18 meeting."
"TOKYO -- Japan's tenuous recovery is relying more and more on a part of the world many Japanese view as their gravest economic threat: China.</br></br>That contrarian view was supported by data released yesterday. Japan's merchandise-trade surplus grew 1.1% in September from a year earlier, to 1.05 trillion yen ($8.43 billion), the seventh rise in as many months. Exports to China soared 40% in the month, the Finance Ministry said, driven by strong sales of semiconductors and cars. That outpaced the 3.8% rise in shipments to the U.S., Japan's largest market.</br></br>The nation's overall surplus barely grew, because imports by Japan rose faster than exports. More troubling, September's trade surplus fell a seasonally adjusted 2.3% from August. ""Exports were weaker than expected,"" said J.P. Morgan economist Ryo Hino, and they are ""clearly trending down.""</br></br>The slackening expansion of the trade surplus is the latest sign that Japan's export-fueled recovery could run out of steam. Expanding the surplus is critical for the world's second-largest economy. The main potential drivers of growth -- spending by consumers and investment by businesses -- continue to slump amid poor corporate profits and pessimism over slipping wages and bleak job prospects.</br></br>Japan snapped a string of four quarterly contractions in its gross domestic product, its worst postwar recession, only after strong exports helped the economy expand at an annualized pace of 1.9% in the April-June quarter. Many economists say they expect Japan to start contracting again before year's end. The International Monetary Fund predicts Japan's GDP will shrink 0.5% in 2002 and grow 1.1% in 2003."
"To investors interested in Eastern Europe, Germany looks like a fountain of profit. West Germany is about to engage in the massive, risky- but undoubtedly rewarding- enterprise of bringing East Germany into the modern world. Its efforts will reach into other post-communist countries, too.</br></br>For individuals, profit-hunting in places like Hungary and Czechoslovakia is simply too chancy. Your best shot will lie in West Germany, whose growth is expected to be electric, and in European companies that have major businesses in Germany. Austria is another thought: It is the major staging area for investing in Czechoslovakia.</br></br>For a dollar investor, German stocks are up about 31 percent since the first breach in the Berlin Wall. In early February, however, the German market started to drop and, recently, the deutsche mark also turned down. For now, there's a general belief that those two markets have further to fall.</br></br>That means that German stocks and deutsche marks may soon be a buy again. Alternatively, consider the general European mutual funds, which, after the economic union of 1992, stand to profit from the growth in business across the continent.</br></br>American Depository Receipts (ADRs) for West German companies. ADRs represent foreign issues. They trade on the U.S. stock exchanges, or off the exchanges in the pink sheets. But they're often too pricey for individuals: around $198 a share for Mannesmann, a construction company, and $86 for Siemens, a leader in electronics. John Dessauer of Dessauer's Journal of Financial Markets recommends both."
"Even before the Senate considered his nomination as U.S. ambassador to Japan, Michael H. Armacost traveled the country to talk to U.S. business executives-a visible sign of the new importance economics and trade holds in the relationship between Tokyo and Washington.</br></br>Armacost, who leaves today to take up his new post, said he told the executives that ""they can count on the American government and its diplomats when they are encountering real obstacles rather than problems of their own making. They can expect the government to be helpful."" ""The American ambassador has to regard himself as the first commercial officer of the embassy,"" Armacost, 52, said during his Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing.</br></br>Under Armacost's predecessor in Japan during the past 12 years, Mike Mansfield, trade grew in importance. But it still was secondary in embassy affairs to more traditional diplomatic aims of maintaining the security ties between the two countries.</br></br>While giving greater emphasis to economic issues, Armacost made it plain that he means to keep a lid on trade frictions before they become serious enough to undermine what Mansfield called the most important bilateral relationship in the world.</br></br>Armacost yesterday told foreign journalists-largely Japanese reporters-that he wants to contribute to the discussion of trade differences ""in a kind of low-key, cool, objective way that avoids histrionics and hyperbole and a lot of unnecessary nationalism on both sides."""
"Weaker than expected retail sales figures for May blew the scent of recession back into the bond market yesterday, a worry that sparked one of the bigger one-day rallies of the past year.</br></br>The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose nearly 2 1/4 points to 114 1/32, or about $22.50 for every $1,000 bond. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 6.54%.</br></br>Movement in the Treasury's two year note was even more dramatic. Its price which is roughly six times more sensitive to movements than the 30-year bond, rose nearly 5/8 of a point, while its yield fell 31 hundredths of a percentage point to 5.61%, its biggest one-day move in five years.</br></br>Traders, investors and economists said the weak retail sales figures for May -- a 0.2% gain compared with expectations of 0.6% -- confirmed suspicions about the economy's weakness. Moreover, they said once again Federal Reserve Board policy makers are under pressure to cut short-term rates soon.</br></br>""The fundamentals are now more positive [for a cut in rates] than when we had the weak unemployment numbers [on June 2],"" said Lee Quaintance, head of government bond trading at CS First Boston."
"But prices finished well below their midsession peaks as interest rates, which started off the day with a decline, inched up again.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average, which had fallen nearly 110 points in the past four sessions, ended 9.90 points higher at 2225.77. The average had been up more than 25 points at its highest level of the day.</br></br>Analysts noted that traders began to step up their buying Wednesday when the Dow briefly dipped below 2200. The belief that stocks were due for a rally got some support Thursday when interest rates turned downward in the credit markets. But as the decline in the bond market faded, so did the upswing in stocks.</br></br>Many Wall Streeters took a positive view of Citicorp‰Ûªs decision this week to increase by $3 billion its reserves against loans to less-developed countries.</br></br>Elsewhere in the bank group, J.P. Morgan picked up 2% to 44%; Chase Manhattan 1% to 36%; Chemical New York 1% to 41%, and Manufacturers Hanover 1 to 39%."
"Indonesia's attempt to sell bonds to local investors fell flat Monday, stymieing the government's effort to reduce the volatility of its currency.</br></br>The Ministry of Finance had been looking to raise $450 million through its first-ever offering of bonds denominated in U.S. dollars to local investors. But weak demand for the bonds, with a coupon rate of 3.5%, meant the government was only able to raise $190 million--less than half its target.</br></br>The bond sale comes as investors around the globe are waiting for the U.S. Federal Reserve to start cutting back on its massive stimulus effort. Indonesian markets have been among the hardest hit by expectations the Fed will soon pull back on its $85-billion-a-month bond-buying program, a move that is expected to send U.S. interest rates higher and make emerging markets less attractive. Countries with both a fiscal deficit and current-account deficit, like Indonesia, rely heavily on foreign investment and can see their currencies plunge if investors flee.</br></br>The debt sale was part of an effort to stabilize Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, which has already fallen by more than 20% against the dollar this year. The sale of the bonds was designed to increase the pool of dollars in the country to help meet local demand for the U.S. currency. Having more dollars on hand can help lessen the currency shock when foreign investors depart.</br></br>Already, Bank Indonesia has raised its benchmark interest rate by a percentage point since late August, to 7.5%. Higher interest rates tend to draw overseas investors, and the move was widely seen as an effort to shield the economy from the turbulence that is expected when the Fed winds down its easy-money program."
"NEW YORK -- It is the world's largest software company and accounts for 10% of the Nasdaq 100 Index, but Microsoft has been overlooked by the recent rally.</br></br>The stock is basically flat for the year, compared with a 26% jump for the Nasdaq 100 and 15% rise for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. That lag has caught the attention of options traders and strategists, some of whom are seeking ways to position for a possible rebound of the software company relative to the broad market.</br></br>Neil Herman, Lehman Brothers' software analyst, said he believes the Redmond, Wash., company is well positioned for the coming quarter. Although summer can be a slow season for software revenue, Microsoft remains a good defensive play, he said in a research note; after all, it isn't clear if technology spending will pick up to the extent many investors had hoped as they loaded up on more volatile tech stocks.</br></br>Other strategists pointed out how Microsoft has underperformed compared with sectors such as biotechnology and semiconductors and could catch up if investors believed these other sectors were becoming overbought.</br></br>Meanwhile, implied volatility of three-month options on Microsoft is a bit below average levels during the past year, making its calls relatively inexpensive, Lehman options strategist James Hosker said."
"Back in 1965, inflation was becoming bothersome. Prices began rising as the Vietnam War was heating up and the military was monopolizing a lot of the nation's productive capacity.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average, meanwhile, was going nowhere. Stocks just weren't attractive when there was inflation to worry about.</br></br>Inflation was on the rise again in 1973, this time because Arab members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries were creating an oil shortage. And the Dow took a beating. Once again, inflation and stocks didn't mix.</br></br>But there have been other times when Wall Street handled inflation well. If the prices of a manufacturer's products are automatically rising with inflation, that company's profits will also climb - at least until costs catch up. So there is an excuse - although a weak one - for people to bid up the price of equities.</br></br>Today, inflation may or may not be getting worse. There are reasonable arguments for either view. Nevertheless, the government's numbers say that inflation is worsening, with prices at the producer level rising last month at a 7.2 percent annual rate and consumer prices jumping by 4.8 percent a year."
"Amid happy bedlam on the three dozen bond trading floors scattered about the New York metropolitan area, a piercing wail of anguish rose last week from the respected Bridgewater Associates Inc.'s bond managers.</br></br>""This bond rally has been brutal,"" said the Wilton, Conn.-based investment advisory firm's daily report, as it agonizingly confessed it had recently lost heart and bet against the bond market rise. ""For years, it seems, we've been waiting for a secular breakout of bond yields to 1960's levels. Here it is, and we're short. Obviously it's painful to have missed this move.""</br></br>The bond trading business - with the exception of the short-lived and perilous junk bond boom of the late 1980s - has traditionally been a back room gentlemen's game. It was the stock market that drew the headlines, the high rollers and the rapt attention of millions of small investors.</br></br>""The stock market is a lot easier for the layman to understand,"" said Larry Jones, president and chief executive of the GovPX Treasury market pricing service, which provides instant computer data on bond trading. ""The bond market is different in that it is a fairly complex animal. It depends on macroeconomics,"" a measurement of the economy on a national scale, ""which {small investors} may have taken in college, but they do not understand the real dynamics.""</br></br>Now they hunger to know more, and are joining institutional investors in tossing money into a bond market that has reached record levels in the past few weeks. With President Clinton's deficit reduction and tax policies indicating a slow-growth, low-inflation economy to many investors, with interest on overnight deposits at a minuscule 3 percent and with the stock market volatile and life uncertain, bonds have become hot items even as long-term Treasury interest rates have sunk to an all-time low of less than 7 percent."
"Employers cut jobs in April for the fourth month in a row, but the small size of the drop -- 20,000 jobs -- and a dip in the unemployment rate offered a tentative sign that the U.S. economy might be escaping a deep recession.</br></br>Despite the better-than-expected news, the economy is not healthy. Car sales hit their lowest level in nearly a decade in April, while the fall in home prices is accelerating and consumers are feeling the pain of higher food and energy bills. The decline in the unemployment rate to 5% from 5.1% reflects an increase in part-time jobs. The number of workers with full-time jobs declined.</br></br>The U.S. economy needs to add 100,000 jobs a month to keep up with population growth. ""You can't lose jobs on a continual basis and have the kind of growth in the economy that you want,"" said Lehman Brothers economist Drew Matus. He predicted shrinking payrolls for the rest of this year.</br></br>Still, the decline in payrolls in April -- Wall Street forecasters had anticipated an 85,000 drop -- suggests the economic fallout from the housing bust and credit crunch that began last year may be less severe than had been widely assumed as recently as last week.</br></br>The jobs report buoyed an already-rising stock market and strengthened the dollar. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which fell below 12,000 in March, rose 48.20 points Friday, or 0.37%, to close at 13,058.20."
"i LIMA,Oct. 7 ‰ÛÓ Peru‰Ûªs reported purchse of 12 supersonic Mirage fightar‰ÛÓbombers from France could become the decisive factor in turning this country‰Ûªs current economic icrisis into outright disaster.</br></br>[ The controversy over the Ijots carries with it the likelihood of a drastic reduction in United States aid to the government of President Fernando Belaunde Terry. At least, it has ended for the foreseeable future any hope of a large U.S. loan to help tide Belaunde over his budgetary and balance of payments problems.</br></br>Moreover, neutral economic observers agree that a massive infusion of outside financial assistance s essential if Peru is to stave off rapid deterioration of its fiscal positpon. Without such aid, they forecast, it will be only a matter of months befoe the economy becomes paralyzed by a debased curency and mounting inflation.</br></br>This prospect stands in bleak contrast to the high hopes expressed only a short while ago for Peru and its liberal, reform-minded President. That the outlook has taken such a marked turn.for the worse is a tributbel largely to the power of the armed forces and their desire to make Peru the first Latin American country outside of Communist Cuba to possess supersonic iets.</br></br>Because of this power and the military‰Ûªs long history of using it to intervene in politics, Belaunde is catering to the desires of the armed forces."
"Over the past 15 or 20 years, the amount of work done by Americans for pay has gone up dramatically, largely because more and more women have taken jobs outside their homes. This added source of labor helped boost economic growth, but the chart at the right suggests that this phenomenon may have just about run its course.</br></br>The chart, the work of economist David Kelly of Lehman Brothers Inc. in Boston, is based on two norms in American society:</br></br>So multiplying by 40 the number of Americans between those ages who are not in hospitals or prisons gives a measure of the total number of hours that would be worked if all those people had jobs and put in a typical week. That figure naturally rises as the population and work force grow.</br></br>Of course, not everyone in the 16-65 age group either has a job or wants one. Millions of people, particularly younger ones, are full-time students. Additional millions of women, and some men, do not hold jobs because they are taking care of a home and, perhaps, children. Some have disabilities or illnesses that prevent them from working. Others may not need to work to make money, or, discouraged by unsuccessful searches for jobs, have simply quit looking. And finally, there are 7.9 million unemployed people looking for work.</br></br>The line on the chart shows the actual hours Americans have worked as a share of potential hours. Fluctuating between 60 percent and 64 percent for many years, the share of potential hours being worked began to rise in the latter half of the 1970s, essentially because a rising proportion of women took jobs for pay instead of working at home for no pay."
"Bank of America Corp. and some of its largest mortgage investors clashed on Tuesday as the bank vowed to fight government-backed demands that it repurchase loans that allegedly didn't meet underwriting guidelines and other promises.</br></br>The bank acknowledged receiving a Monday letter from investors alleging that a Bank of America unit didn't properly service 115 bond deals. The investors include Freddie Mac, the government-owned mortgage company. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, its larger sibling, have boosted demands on lenders over the past year to buy back defaulted loans that had been sold to and guaranteed by the mortgage titans.</br></br>But Tuesday's action marks the first step by either company to force banks to buy back mortgage-backed securities that were issued by Wall Street, not by government-backed mortgage giants.</br></br>Other investors, some of whom were acting on behalf of their clients, include the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Neuberger Berman Group LLC, BlackRock Inc., Western Asset Management Co. and Allianz SE's Pacific Investment Management Co., or Pimco, according to people familiar with the matter.</br></br>The Charlotte, N.C., bank hoped the lifting of its foreclosure sale moratorium would debunk fears that the mortgage process was flawed. But investors grappled with new concerns Tuesday that the bank could be overwhelmed with investor requests to repurchase flawed mortgages made before the U.S. housing collapse. Its shares dropped 54 cents or 4.4% to $11.80. The shares have declined more than 30% since the end of April amid worries about regulatory reform, lackluster revenues and weak loan demand."
"WASHINGTON -- A move to grant the Securities and Exchange Commission authority to halt program trading is gaining steam in Washington.</br></br>Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), chairman of the House finance and telecommunications subcommittee, said he plans on Tuesday to propose an amendment to the pending market-reform bill that would give the SEC that power.</br></br>Aides from the House subcommittee are working with SEC and Treasury Department staffers to formulate an exact proposal that all three sides can accept. The amendment wouldn't specify when program trading would be curbed, but it would allow the SEC to set guidelines. Details of the legislation are likely to be worked out over the weekend. Rep. Markey apparently doesn't feel that he can push the amendment through without support from the two agencies.</br></br>Meanwhile, SEC Chairman Richard Breeden has agreed to accept a provision in the Senate version of the market-reform bill that would allow the agency to close the stock market in emergencies, Senate aides said. Mr. Breeden had opposed the measure, which was proposed by his predecessor, David Ruder. But Mr. Breeden now has indicated he would accept the proposal if it is modified to require that the president approve any market halt sought by the SEC chairman. Currently, only the president has the power to close the market.</br></br>The Senate Banking Committee is likely to take up the bill again next week."
"With economists at a loss to explain it and central bankers at a loss to control it, the dollar yesterday continued its rise on world currency markets, breaking through key trading barriers on its way to an 18-month high.</br></br>The rise came despite efforts by the United States, Japan and several other governments to quiet the rally by selling dollars on the foreign exchange markets. In Washington, the White House issued a statement declaring that a further rise could ""undermine international efforts to reduce global trade imbalances.""</br></br>One anomaly of the dollar's surge-and the mirror-image weakness of the Japanese yen and West German mark-is that it seems to fly in the face of common-sense economics: the currency of a country with major trade and budget deficit problems (the United States) is going up, while the currencies of key surplus countries (Japan and West Germany) are weakening.</br></br>But the exchange markets appeared undeterred, as traders seemed to ""have the bit between their teeth,"" in the words of one investment banker. In European trading, the dollar zoomed through the psychological barrier of 2 marks to close at 2.01 marks, and through the reported target ceiling of 140 yen to close at 142.05 yen in New York.</br></br>Since low points at the beginning of the year, when the dollar dipped to 121 yen and 1.58 marks, it has risen about 18 percent against the yen and 28 percent against the mark."
"The nation‰Ûªs unemployment rate edged down in November to 5.8 percent of the work force, indicating the economy may be somewhat stronger than expected despite widespread forecasts of a recession, the government reported yesterday.</br></br>Although the drop, from a 6 percent rate the previous month, came as a surprise to some analysts, it did not alter predictions that the nation is heading into a slump. Other major statistics have shown the economy is slowing.</br></br>However, the failure of the jobless rate to rise was expected to stiffen the reluctance of the Carter administration to propose an anti-recession tax cut as part of the fiscal 1981 budget it will send Congress in January.</br></br>President Carter is scheduled to make a final decision on the tax-cut issue within another two or three weeks, before the budget goes to press.

"Author: Robbie Whelan</br></br>Some of the nation's largest home builders might be forced to buy hundreds of acres of desert 10 miles from the Las Vegas Strip at boom-era prices as part of a legal battle with a group of banks led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.</br></br>If a judge rules in favor of the banks over builders such as KB Home and Toll Brothers Inc., it could cast a shadow over a popular but controversial form of off-balance-sheet accounting used when buying land. The strategy is used by builders to insulate themselves from debt and other obligations.</br></br>The development, called Inspirada, is another housing-crisis casualty in Nevada, one of the hardest-hit U.S. states.

"NEW YORK -- Prices of Treasury bonds slumped yesterday as dealers and investors were shaken by a sharp drop in the U.S. dollar's value against other major currencies.</br></br>Some actively traded U.S. government bonds fell more than half a point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount. Interest rates declined at the weekly auction of Treasury bills, but most other short-term rates rose.</br></br>Adding to investor jitters was a rise in the price of oil. Prices of gold and other precious metals viewed as harbingers of inflation also rose.</br></br>""Investors are growing increasingly concerned that the dollar's weakness could make foreigners reluctant to buy dollar-denominated securities,"" said Maury N. Harris, chief economist at PaineWebber Inc. Foreign investors have purchased large amounts of Treasury bonds in recent years, helping the U.S. government finance its huge budget deficits.</br></br>Furthermore, a continued drop in the dollar might rekindle inflationary pressures and cause the Federal Reserve not to ease credit, some investment managers say. Analysts generally have been expecting the Fed to drive interest rates lower to try to to stimulate economic growth."
"WASHINGTON -- Congress, in approving the sale of Consolidated Rail Corp., said the government should try to get $2 billion for the freight carrier. But a number of factors may make it difficult to achieve that goal.</br></br>The complicating factors, analysts said, include a decision by lawmakers to impose tough rules for the tax treatment of Conrail's eventual buyers, uncertainty about the future of the economy and the stock market, and the lingering threat posed by continuing efforts to increase regulatory controls on railroads.</br></br>""The price the government gets through selling the shares does, of course, depend on market conditions,"" Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole said in an interview, adding that ""there are reasons why you may not reach"" the congressional goal of $2 billion. But she said she was pleased that the House dropped its insistence on a minimum price of $1.7 billion, which investment advisers had warned could kill the sale outright.</br></br>Congress's $2 billion goal represents a projected sale price of $1.7 billion for the government's 85% stake in the Northeast railroad, and the transfer of up to $300 million to government coffers from Conrail's ample cash reserves.</br></br>Lawmakers set the goal before they settled on more stringent tax treatment for Conrail than the administration wanted. Analysts estimate the tax decision could depress the sale price by $200 million to $500 million."
"Japan's political leaders feel singed by three months of acrimonious exchanges between their country and America. They limit their public statements about Japanese-American relations to a bare minimum these days, measuring out their words with great caution.</br></br>They are trying to walk the U.S.-Japan relationship back from the brink that suddenly appeared as emotions were jarred on both sides of the Pacific this winter by President Bush's provocative ""jobs"" trip and the injudicious Japanese statements about America's work habits that followed.</br></br>But this does not mean that they have changed their view that America's problems are primarily of America's making and will have to be resolved without significant new concessions from Japan.</br></br>Some of the recent turmoil is temporary and built on misunderstandings, just as officials on each side assert in their public statements.</br></br>But what is not being said publicly is perhaps more important. The tensions between Tokyo and Washington spring from a new current of uncertainty and potential conflict as two powerful, dissimilar allies grope for new world roles beyond the Cold War."
"Graduating college students have higher job expectations this year than did graduates a year ago, but less chance of finding the job they want, a recent survey said.</br></br>There are fewer entry-level jobs with the responsibility, salary and benefits the new graduates seek, according to a survey by Snelling Personnel Services of Dallas.</br></br>The survey polled more than 275 Snelling employment offices nationwide. Of those, 48 percent said the number of entry-level jobs has decreased since last year.</br></br>The greatest decline in entry-level jobs was in accounting, marketing and general management trainee positions. Businesses that want to be lean and mean are trimming office support staff and turning to temporary workers, said Robert Snelling, chairman of the company.</br></br>Not so encouraging is news about salaries. Almost three-quarters of the Snelling offices said salary levels for available jobs are down this year from last."
"Wall Street turned lower Wednesday as investors worried that a sharp jump in oil prices could be another sign that consumers are under stress in an economy that is showing signs of a recession. The major indicators, which spent most of the session in a tight trading range, tumbled after oil prices shot higher in response to the Energy Department's report of an unexpected jump in gasoline demand.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 48.53, or 0.38 percent, to 12,605.83 after changing direction several times. Broader market indicators also fell. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.65, or 0.19 percent, to 1367.53, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 1.35, or 0.06 percent, to 2361.40.</br></br>The credit crisis and weak economy have sent stocks tumbling in the past six months. But the market had shown some renewed confidence that the worst of the credit problems might be behind Wall Street; that upbeat sentiment sent stocks up nearly 400 points on Tuesday, the first day of the second quarter.</br></br>Some of the pullback late Wednesday also was pinned on profit-taking after that big advance. Also Wednesday, Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said he expected the economy to contract in the first half of the year -- a trend that would mean the United States is in a recession.</br></br>Treasury bonds moved slightly lower as investors weighed Bernanke's testimony before Congress; fixed-income investors were focused on hints from Bernanke that the central bank might be less aggressive about lowering interest rates. The 10-year Treasury note's yield, which moves opposite its price, rose to 3.6 percent."
"President Reagan will nominate John P. LaWare, a Boston banker described as a pragmatist and an advocate of bank deregulation, to the Federal Reserve Board, the White House announced yesterday.</br></br>If LaWare is confirmed by the Senate, his appointment will mean that Reagan has named all seven members of the board, which regulates banks and influences the economy by rationing the supply of money and credit.</br></br>Unlike some of Reagan's previous Fed appointees, LaWare isn't known as an ideological supporter of supply-side economics. Indeed, the 60-year-old banker isn't even a Republican. But administration officials were said to be more interested in appointing a knowledgeable banker and business executive to a Fed Board that is otherwise dominated by economists, including Chairman Alan Greenspan and Vice Chairman Manual Johnson.</br></br>LaWare is ""a very meticulous, pragmatic kind of banker,"" said Robert Eisenmenger, first vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. ""He's conservative, but not an ideologue at all."" Eisenmenger added that LaWare is very good at ""working in a group environment,"" a quality much admired within the collegial central bank.</br></br>As chairman of Shawmut National Corp. and Shawmut Bank in Boston, LaWare has been a staunch supporter of deregulating the banking industry. He has actively supported legislation to loosen restrictions on interstate banking and ease regulations on the rescue of troubled banks by healthy banks."

Japan's government reiterated it is committed to finding a solution for mortgage lenders by Dec. 20. Japan's top banks, too, have said they would act to write off their bad loans in the fiscal second half ending March 31. The market also was cheered by Wall Street, which logged its fourth all-time high in a row on Monday. Meanwhile, the Nikkei also got a boost from big rollovers of December futures contracts into March positions."
"CANADA experienced a record population growth during the 1950s, resulting since 1955 in larger imports</br></br>Although imports exceeded exports, the Canadian dollar rose to the highest pre mium in history, accord ing to William Mc- tained inflow of capital from abroad, mostly long-term in character, has been more than sufficient to offset the trade deficit; under the Canadian policy of letting the exchange rate fluctuate freely, in response to demand and supply on the exchange market, this inflow has boosted the value of the Canadian dollar in the foreign-pxchange market.‰Û</br></br>In a word, the rise of the Canadian dollar was due to the large influx of American and other capital for investment in Canadian companies; the sale of Canadian securities in the New York market, including fraudulent Canadian mining securities. To show the dimensions of these investments, principally American, between October 1955 and March 1957, net direct investments amounted to Canadian S639 million; net new security issues amounted to Canadian $701 million; trade in outstanding securities amounted to Canadian $300 million; other capital flows amounted to Canadian $390 million. Also, Canada increased its official holdings of gold and U.

After the Korean boom, there were significant tax reductions for fiscal years 1953-54 and 1955-56. The tax reductions for 1953-54 consisted mainly in eliminating a surchai‰Ûªge' on individual income taxes and a reduction in the corporate profits tax. Similar but small reductions characterized the rate changes for 1955-56, introduced when the extent and timing of the economic recovery was still unknown. For 1957-58, there were smaller cuts in indirect taxes, reducing aggregate tax revenues by about 1 per cent and still leaving an increased budget surplus.‰Û"
"Money manager T. Rowe Price Group Inc. warned investors yesterday to expect a sharp drop in its first-quarter earnings because the stock market's decline sent the value of the firm's mutual funds and the fees it earns on those holdings sharply lower.</br></br>George A. Roche, T. Rowe Price's chairman and president, said first-quarter earnings per share would be about 30 percent lower than the 41 cents per share the company earned for the same period last year. Investment advisory fees dropped 10 percent from the first quarter of last year, Roche said, addressing shareholders at the company's annual meeting in Baltimore.</br></br>The falling stock market is having a direct effect on the bottom lines of mutual fund companies because funds usually charge customers based on a percentage of the dollar value of their investments.</br></br>At Price, the nation's eighth-largest mutual fund family, those fees made up about three-quarters of total revenue last year. It had $140 billion in total assets under management at the end of the quarter, down 12.4 percent from a year ago.</br></br>""Management can't do all that much right now,"" said Kenneth Worthington, an analyst for CIBC World Markets. ""This comes down to market conditions improving and the stock market going up and people putting more money"" in mutual funds, he said."
"More Trials Expected</br></br>For Great Lakes States</br></br>WHICH REGION will suffer most in the next recession? Data Resources says it's the same one that got stung worst in the last four economic downturns: the Great Lakes states.</br></br>The Lexington, Mass., economic-consulting firm has produced a scenario that assumes a relatively severe recession starting in late 1989, with the nation's economic output falling four percentage points by the fourth quarter of 1990 and interest rates surging. In this model, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin would lose 10% of their manufacturing jobs by the end of 1990.</br></br>Does all this sound familiar? In the major recessions of 1975 and 1982, and in the less severe slumps of 1960 and 1970, the Great Lakes states also sustained the biggest percentage job losses of any region."

The department also said prices at the personal-spending level, after stripping out food and energy costs, ticked up 0.1 percent in April.</br></br>The readings were in line with the market's expectations and supported the notion that high commodities costs are not yet causing a sharp pullback in spending or lifting prices for other goods.

Previous mobile-phone systems use a single high-powered transmitter for an area, thereby limiting the number of calls that can be made simultaneously to about two dozen."
"Nobody-not the financial markets, not the public, not the Bush administration and not Congress-is really worried about the current level of inflation, says economist Joel Popkin, because it still looks good in comparison with the late 1970s and early '80s.</br></br>""Back in the '60s and early '70s,"" says Popkin, whose consulting firm specializes in tracking inflation, ""we used to worry about `creeping' inflation-inflation in the 5 to 6 percent range. Nixon put in price controls when inflation was just about where it is now."" But ever since the second OPEC oil shock sent prices spiraling, ""double-digit inflation has become the standard against which to measure."" Anything less than that doesn't get us excited.</br></br>Popkin can point to plenty of supporting evidence: After a brief flurry of concern, the financial markets shrugged off the sharp jump in consumer prices-and an even sharper jump in producer prices-recorded in January; consumer confidence is running at a 20-year high (though purchases of autos and other interest-sensitive consumer durables have sagged a bit); and both the administration and Congress have registered less than enthusiasm for Chairman Greenspan's anti-inflation crusade.</br></br>That's too bad. If inflation is building up a head of steam, the only way to diffuse it short of a deep recession is for everyone to start checking their inflationary impulses. Businesses need to moderate price hikes and profit margins, workers must moderate wage and benefit demands and, most important, businesses, workers-and government-need to consume less and save more so that U.S. productive capacity can expand. But building inflation resistance requires strong leadership-which is not much in evidence outside the Fed.</br></br>""I am afraid you are sowing the seeds of a recession,"" Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.) told Greenspan at a Budget Committee hearing last week where the Fed chairman defended the credit-squeezing policies that have driven up short-term rates by 3 percentage points over the last several months."
"It's no secret that New York City real estate is in the doldrums, but to understand just how bad things have gotten, consider the case of Howard Ronson.</br></br>When Mr. Ronson's HRO International started investing in New York City real estate in 1979, it led a charge of foreign buyers who were convinced the city's best days were ahead of it.</br></br>Over the next 10 years, the British-born builder became one of the city's most lionized real estate men, developing a half dozen office projects that included the headquarters for the now defunct securities firm Thomson McKinnon Inc. Most of HRO's projects were in prime midtown and downtown locations; many were preleased.</br></br>Last December, one of Mr. Ronson's midtown properties filed for bankruptcy protection, the victim of a soft rental market. Then early this month, an HRO-led partnership that owned a 30-story downtown tower with views of New York harbor filed for bankruptcy protection. The next day, the million-square-foot building that once housed Thomson McKinnon filed for bankruptcy protection as well. Mr. Ronson, presumably, forfeited whatever equity stake he had in the three buildings.</br></br>""He's a first class developer but he got caught in a terrible market,"" said one of Mr. Ronson's lenders. An HRO spokesman declined to comment."
"I NEW YORK, Nov. 22 lAl‰Ûªli The stock market retreated again today under the continued barrage of drab economic news but perked up and cut its losses late tn the day In hope that President Johnson might succeed In avoiding a tax boost.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average ended with a loss of 3.18 at 794.98, having recovered from a loss of 7.90 at 790.20.

"Out my window on 19th Street in Washington, there are office buildings under construction in both directions as far as the eye can see. A few blocks away three large luxury hotels are nearing completion. Am I seeing the rosy pink cheeks of a healthy economy, or the feverish flush that preceeds the patient's final collapse?</br></br>The Wall Street Journal editorial page generally tends toward the first view. The Journal's editors have been among the most joyful promoters of the new dispensation wherein conservatives spread nothing but happiness and optimism, leaving liberals to wallow in bad vibes and gloomy analogies. In the past couple of weeks, however, a discordant autumnal note has intruded. The shadow of 1929 has passed across the editorial page, and even across the furrowed brow of the editor himself. In a Sept. 5 article entitled ""Toying With Depression,"" he observed that comparisons between then and now are ""instructive, not to mention eerie."" What alarms him most -- with good reason -- is the rise in protectionist sentiment. However, he takes touching comfort in the thought that ""We are singularly lucky to have an old and experienced president who lived through it the last time."" Ronald Reagan will save us.</br></br>It remains to be seen whether President Reagan will show any more fortitude in defending free trade than he has shown lately in defending some of his other, less admirable principles. It also remains to be seen whether we are plunging into another depression. If we are, though, history will not see Mr. Reagan's role as that of savior. More likely, the Smoot-Hawley tariff of the new depression -- the act of willful madness that planted the seeds of catastrophe -- will be identified not as whatever protectionist nonsense Congress is cooking up, but as Mr. Reagan's own 1981 tax act. That act set the government off on a debt binge and radically distorted economic incentives in the private economy.</br></br>The most convincing crash scare story I've seen yet is the cover article in the Sept. 16 Business Week, called ""The Casino Society."" The article's basic point is that the financial markets, fueled by debt, are steaming away with less and less relationship to the real world. ""The great crash was preceded by rampant stock market speculation -- much of it with borrowed money. . . ."" Today that's not happening on the stock exchange, ""but the speculative use of debt and other forms of leverage is pandemic in the rest of the financial world.""</br></br>Business Week quotes Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman/American Express: ""Heavy borrowers are betting, whether intentionally or not, that inflation will bail them out down the road."" That includes the government. Herbert Stein pointed out in these pages last year that the national debt was worth almost exactly as much in real terms as it had been worth in 1946. In essence, during the whole postwar period until a year ago, we inflated away the debt as fast as we ran it up. But that trick only works once a generation. People catch on. Any attempt to inflate away our new mountain of debt will lead straight to Bolivia."
"Movie-ticket sales in the U.S. totaled about $9.3 billion last year, up at least 11% from 2001, thanks to hits such as ""Spider-Man,"" ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" and 20 other movies that each generated more than $100 million at the box office.</br></br>While Hollywood is crowing it had another ""record"" year, admissions rose a more modest 8% when adjusted for ticket-price inflation. Moreover, the higher ticket sales and attendance figures were due to the proliferation of expensively promoted ""franchise"" movies and sequels, masking what otherwise would have been a bleak year for most studios.</br></br>The estimated 11% increase in ticket sales comes from Exhibitor Relations Co., a closely held firm that analyzes and distributes box-office data it receives from the studios.</br></br>The explosion in sales of digital videodiscs during 2002 will help mitigate any miscalculations the studios made in coming up with more original movies. DVD sales increased 50% to $8.1 billion in 2002, according to Adams Media Research, as consumers showed a willingness to buy low-price discs at mass retailers rather than rent movies. With the new format gaining favor, sales of VHS format videos, which peaked in 1996 at $6 billion, fell to $4.3 billion.</br></br>The rise in ticket sales and attendance also was helped by theater operators increasingly packing 15-plus-screen cinemas with multiple showings of the same movie on opening weekend. This resulted in large opening-weekend box office for movies, but in many cases also led to a steep drop in ticket sales in the following weeks as the next big-event movie rolled into theaters."
"Bonni McKeown says that the proposed Corridor H highway through West Virginia is a bad idea {Close to Home, May 10}. She argues that it is unnecessary to the local economy, will trash the environment and is a pork-barrel project of Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W. Va.) and a few businessmen. She is wrong on all counts.</br></br>West Virginia has the third-highest unemployment rate and the second-lowest per capita income among the 50 states. Further, the six counties through which Corridor H will pass have a higher unemployment rate and a lower per capita income than West Virginia as a whole.</br></br>Nearby counties, which also would be affected by the new road, have similarly dismal statistics. The 18-county region of 325,000 people has one of the poorest performing economies in a poorly performing state.</br></br>The answer is the improved access for business that only Corridor H can provide. Improving existing two-lane roads, as McKeown suggests, won't work. Industries look for four-lane roads. In addition, the cost of the road improvements that she suggests would come close to equaling the cost of Corridor H. Building the corridor also would reduce the need for improvements to the state's two-land roads because it would divert traffic from them.</br></br>As to the argument about trashing the environment: In much of West Virginia now, the only jobs are in coal mining, timbering and other extractive industries. Corridor H would encourage a diversified economy, to the benefit of the environment."

Despite recent signs of recovery, housing -- the principal source of wealth for middle-class households -- remains priced about 25% below its pre-recession peak. Many workers who lost middle-income jobs have found only part-time or low-wage replacements and doubt that they will ever regain their pre-recession standard of living. Not surprisingly, many middle-class parents now doubt that their children will enjoy comparable lives</br></br>Concern about the middle class is not new. Compared with the quarter-century after World War II, recent decades -- though not disastrous -- were disappointing, even before the Great Recession. Many economists define the middle class as those adults whose annual household income is between two-thirds and twice the national median -- today, that means roughly $40,000 to $120,000. By this standard, according to the Pew Research Center, the middle class is significantly smaller than it once was. In 1971, it accounted for fully 61% of adults, compared with 14% for the upper class and 25% for the lower class.</br></br>Four decades later, the middle class share had declined by 10 percentage points to just 51%, while the upper class share increased by six points and the lower class by four. The U.S. income distribution is still a bell curve, but the left and right tails are fatter and the hump in the middle is lower.</br></br>This means that the middle class is less economically and socially dominant than it once was. Relatively speaking, more Americans are enjoying affluent lives at the same time that more are just barely making it (if at all). But that doesn't mean the middle class got poorer. During those 40 years, Pew calculates, the median income of middle-class households (adjusted for inflation) grew by 34%. The median grew for the others as well -- by 43% for upper-income households and 29% for those with incomes below the middle class. This isn't surprising, because the median income for all U.S. households rose by 32% during that period, from $44,845 in 1970 to $59,127 in 2010. Indeed, 86% of middle-class Americans, and 84% of all Americans, enjoy higher incomes than their parents did."
"NEW YORK -- Many options traders were reluctant to take advantage of puts and calls whose prices have been discounted ahead of the Labor Day weekend.</br></br>With the financial markets closed Monday in observance of the holiday, specialists are lowering volatility -- an important part of an options price -- to attract buyers.</br></br>A broad barometer of options prices, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index, or VIX, declined 0.31 to 19.28, a level that is widely regarded as indicating that prices are cheap.</br></br>Specialists hope discounted prices will persuade traders to buy their options, which would transfer ""time decay"" off their trading sheets.</br></br>Time decay is the amount of money an options contract loses each day as it approaches expiration."
"FOR THE unemployed, even short recessions have long tails. That useful reminder is contained in a new report on the likely effects of the current recession, which the administration and most other forecasters have said will be pleasantly brief and mild.</br></br>The report, by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities here,.-observes that the end of a recession is not quite the joyous moment the term implies. The end is a trough, the point at which business activity stops declining, not the point at which the economy regains its former health.</br></br>Unemployment thus tends to stay high long after a recession is officially over; the administration‰Ûªs own economic forecast includes such an expectation. The recession is said to be likely to end about the middle of this year, but the unemployment rate would stay closer to 7 than to 6 percent until well into 1992; for fiscal 1992 rt would average 6.7 percent.</br></br>By recent historical standards that rate wouild not he exceptionally high, but it still represents close to 2 million people more than were unemployed last year. That is not a dismissable number, especially because this recession, for all the eight years of vaunted expansion that preceded it, began with the poverty rate and other signals of distress in the lower reaches of the economy already uncomfortably high. The question is whether the safety net is adequate to the burden about to be put on it; the answer, particularly as to the unemployment insurance system, ia. no.</br></br>the work force. Partly this reflects changes in the work force, partly budget cuts and changes in federal and state law. A major difference at the federal level is that it takes more to turn on so-called extended benefits beyond the 26 weeks that are the national standard. In a lengthy period of heightened unemployment such as even the optimists agree lies ahead, that means that many more workers will exhaust their benefits. Nor can already overburdened welfare, housing and other such programs be counted on to take up the slack."

"NEW YORK -- Hit by a third-straight day of coordinated central-bank intervention, the dollar sank against all major currencies except the pound.</br></br>The main central banks intervened in each other's markets and staggered their dollar sales, continuing a newly practiced approach designed to extract maximum effect from their actions.</br></br>But for the most part, foreign-exchange traders said they don't believe the central banks' unrelenting assault has knocked the market to its knees. They said the dollar can't be pushed much lower unless the interest-rate premium the U.S. enjoys over other major countries is trimmed.</br></br>Also, the sheer size of the dollar's fall this week -- more than seven pfennigs since Friday -- may force central banks to pause to let the market digest the tumble, or their tactics could backfire, traders said.</br></br>Although many dealers said some revision in central banks' tactics must be near, uncertainty over the potential war chest of new approaches ensures trading remains thin and jumpy.

"New York City, which has spent most of the past decade in the rating-agency doghouse, received a big boost as a major credit-rating company upgraded nearly $28 billion of city debt.</br></br>The upgrade to A3 from Baa1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. was certainly good news for scores of investors who own city debt, either through mutual funds or by holding individual bonds. Both the current rating and the old one are ""investment grade,"" but the one-notch upgrade could mean that more mutual funds and other institutional investors will buy city debt. Many institutions are restricted by their own rules in the amount of debt they can own in the B-rated category, where New York City had been.</br></br>Moody's action, which applied to the city's general-obligation bond, was the first upgrade for such bonds since 1988, during former Mayor Edward Koch's administration and just before the city entered a deep recession. In fact, less than three years ago Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, the other big ratings house, downgraded city bonds to BBB-plus from A-minus.</br></br>Market analysts said that city debt prices were largely unchanged by the news, but could improve in the days and weeks to come as more investors decide to buy New York debt again. Like Moody's, Standard & Poor's is seeing the city in a different light, and officials there said they are considering an upgrade of city bonds after New York releases its new budget.</br></br>Can investors sleep tight knowing the rating agencies are keeping close tabs on the city's fiscal health? If you own city debt, you may want to study up on the last time bond raters said the city's finances were improving. In November 1987, Standard & Poor's upgraded city bonds just weeks after the stock market's crash; the market's tailspin caused massive layoffs on Wall Street, a citywide recession and, eventually, lower bond prices. Market participants said S&P didn't anticipate then how seriously New York City would be hurt by the crash."

"You might think that the very first thing the American taxpayer has the right to expect from a financial institution dedicated to maintaining monetary cooperation and the international balance of payments would be some honest bookkeeping. Especially when Uncle Sam is its largest contributor.</br></br>Think again.</br></br>Forget about looking for the answer in the U.S. budget. America's contribution to the International Monetary Fund is an off-budget item. And Congress has long preferred to pretend that the billions of dollars in loans that the U.S. makes to the Fund cost the U.S. taxpayer, as Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin put it in 1998, ""not one dime."" Naturally, this line of thinking is just fine with the IMF, which is happy to avoid the closer scrutiny that would be sure to follow if Congress ever admitted that its U.S. funding is not cost- free.</br></br>Though such logic (not to mention such arithmetic) was always suspect, a new study shows just how flawed it really is. The U.S. contribution to the IMF, says Adam Lerrick of the Gailliot Center at Carnegie Mellon University, has cost the U.S. an average of $1.5 billion a year since 1991. This year those costs will reach $1.9 billion. It sure would be nice if Congress noticed.</br></br>Mr. Lerrick reaches his conclusions using a set of facts that are difficult to argue with. Start with the fact the Fund makes large loans at low interest rates to such risky economies as Argentina or Indonesia or Russia -- countries that aren't like to repay soon (if ever)."

"The Food and Drug Administration last night approved a long- awaited drug for a form of viral hepatitis, expanding treatment options for a disease that afflicts more than 1 million Americans.</br></br>The action was a significant boost for Gilead Sciences Inc., a Foster City, Calif., biotechnology company that has built a strong portfolio of antiviral drugs. Gilead already sells one of the country's fastest-growing AIDS treatments, and analysts have said the new hepatitis B drug, known as Hepsera or adefovir dipivoxil, could bring revenue of $200 million a year or more.</br></br>Hepatitis is a slow-to-develop but life-threatening ailment that can lead to cancer or catastrophic liver failure. Many liver doctors had been awaiting the action the FDA took last night. Unsatisfied with two drugs already on the market, which have severe limitations, the doctors held off treatment for many patients healthy enough to wait. They also had been seeking a new treatment for seriously ill patients who have exhausted all other options.</br></br>""It works dramatically"" in many patients for whom another antiviral drug, lamviudine, has stopped working, said Eugene Schiff, head of the Center for Liver Diseases at the University of Miami School of Medicine and a consultant to Gilead. ""It's not a perfect drug, but there's no question it's an advance in hepatitis B.""</br></br>The new drug is one of a growing number of spinoffs from the nation's investment in AIDS research. It was originally developed as an AIDS drug but proved too toxic in that use and was turned down by the FDA. However, it proved effective against the hepatitis B virus at far lower, and therefore safer, doses. It works by blocking reproduction of the virus."
"The nation's governors, alarmed by a steep decline in revenues last month, appealed yesterday to Congress and the Bush administration for emergency assistance. Unless help comes soon, they warned, states will have to slash their spending, thereby increasing the risk of a serious recession.</br></br>Michigan Gov. John Engler (R), the chairman of the National Governors Association, told reporters in a conference call from Lansing that since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, many states have seen a double-digit drop in tax receipts compared with a year ago.</br></br>The governors suggested steps they would like to see included in the stimulus package being drafted on Capitol Hill, with the blessing of the Bush administration.</br></br>In addition to expanded unemployment, health and other benefits for families of laid-off workers, they asked for relief from some federal regulations and the suspension of state matching requirements on major federal highway, airport and other construction programs.</br></br>Engler and Kentucky Gov. Paul E. Patton (D), who is vice chairman of the governors association and presented the program to members of Congress yesterday, emphasized that unless help comes soon, balanced- budget requirements in most state constitutions will force program cuts and layoffs, deepening the economic slump."
"Corrections & Amplifications</br></br>SOLECTRON Corp.'s 50% debt-to-capital covenant pertains to two credit lines, which the company says it hasn't drawn down. Yesterday's Heard on the Street column didn't specify which of Solectron's sources of funds contained the covenant.</br></br>(WSJ Sept. 24, 2002)</br></br>WHEN COMPANIES take big charges to earnings to write down ""goodwill"" they often urge investors to ignore the charges as mere accounting entries that don't affect their operating performance or financial stability. But bankers may not be so easily spun.</br></br>Potential write-downs of goodwill assets by several big companies are looming -- and may place them in jeopardy of violating covenants on their borrowing agreements. By itself, this doesn't mean that any of these companies will be pushed into default on their debt. But it could give banks leverage to win concessions from the borrowers, such as higher interest rates and fees, the pledging of assets as security or agreements by the companies to pay off their loans sooner."
"WASHINGTON -- Retail sales and consumer prices both increased moderately in August.</br></br>The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.2% last month to $173.52 billion. The rise was the latest in a five-month string, but it was slower than the previous four months. Meanwhile, the Labor Department said consumer prices rose 0.3% in August, after increasing 0.1% in July and remaining unchanged in June. Excluding food and energy, prices also rose 0.3%, faster than the 0.1% rise in each of the two previous months.</br></br>Analysts said the slight acceleration in consumer prices last month and the slowdown in retail sales don't change their view of the U.S. economy. Prices are pretty well behaved, and consumers seem willing to spend despite their sagging confidence and the slow job market. Still, investors reacted negatively to the economic reports, pushing bond and stock prices lower.</br></br>Richmond Federal Reserve President J. Alfred Broaddus said the consumer price rise in August was ""a little bit of a disappointment"" given the tiny rise in prices from May through July. But Mr. Broaddus also seemed encouraged by consumer demand, which was strong in the second quarter. He said demand ""will continue to rise"" unless the job market and incomes weaken.</br></br>""My overall sense is that retail activity is pretty healthy-healthier than employment and, especially, consumer confidence suggests,"" said Charles Lieberman, director of financial markets research at Chemical Securities Inc. in New York."
"NEW YORK, June 30 UP)‰ÛÓThe stock market ran up its string of daily gains to four straight in active dealings today.</br></br>Key issues were ahead from fractions to a point or so. Some exceptions made wider gains. There was a scattering of losers.</br></br>Industrials carried the ball in the advance. Rails were mixed, utilities barely nudged ahead on average, but made a new high for the year in so doing.</br></br>It looked like a stalemate for the first couple of hours. Prices were mixed except for the assortment of lower-priced stocks which have been in great demand lately. Around mid-session steels, aircrafts and electronics made strides and prices picked up throughout the list. A final rally by oils put prices at their best of the day by the close.</br></br>The overall gain was moderate. Market background included the record total of consti'uction awards for May and a pickup in defense purchases by the Government A slowing of steel industry output and some uncertainty about the question of higher steel pi'ices also were factors."
"LONDON -- The London Stock Exchange is coming under increasing pressure to respond in detail to questions raised by critics of its proposed merger with Deutsche Boerse AG.</br></br>But exchange officials are warning that owners of the two exchanges may have to vote on the merger plan before many of the questions can be answered.</br></br>The exchanges last month announced plans for a merger that would create a new pan-European exchange called iX and involve a joint venture with the U.S.-based Nasdaq Stock Market, which is owned by the National Association of Securities Dealers. The agreement is subject to approval by owners of 75% of the shares in each exchange in votes expected to be held in September. Officials of the London exchange, known as the LSE, may have trouble winning enough votes from the 298 member firms that own the bourse.</br></br>In early July, the two exchanges are due to give their owners an information memorandum on the deal, expected to be more than 100 pages long. Indications of its contents could be given to key London bankers tomorrow, when Werner Seifert, who is the chief executive of Deutsche Boerse and would hold the same post at iX, attends a meeting of an LSE committee that helps set trading rules.</br></br>An LSE spokesman said the document will include projections for the prospects of iX but won't delve into issues beyond the exchanges' immediate control, such as regulation, settlement and the effect of the deal on stock indexes."
"Until Friday, Wall Street seemed to be staging its own version of a patriotic rally. After the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, an already battered stock market went into near free fall. At the market's bottom, 10 days later, the Dow Jones industrial average had tumbled more than 14 percent, the Nasdaq had slumped 16 percent and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had dropped nearly 12 percent. But then the market reversed course. By the end of the day Thursday -- one month after the attacks -- both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 had recouped all of their post-Sept. 11 losses.</br></br>On Friday, the rally took a breather, with most of the major indexes posting modest losses, weighed down by a disappointing report on retail sales and higher-than-expected producer prices. At one point Friday, the Dow plunged 100 points in just a few minutes after the first report of a case of anthrax at NBC News in New York, reaching a loss of more than 200 points. But the Dow clawed its way back late in the day, closing with a loss of just 66 points; the Nasdaq actually closed a little higher Friday.</br></br>The bullish camp theorizes that things have gotten as bad as possible, that there's no place for the market to go but up. The country is, after all, already in a state of war. The economy clearly has fallen into a recession. Earnings will be bad this quarter and next. And the tech sector remains mired in a slump that's now more than a year old. But the markets already have adjusted for all of that.</br></br>On the other hand, the market likes the fact that the early days of the war have gone without a hitch, with no U.S. combat deaths or injuries. Meanwhile, both Congress and the Federal Reserve have shown a determination to prop up the faltering economy. Following two half- point cuts in the past month, the federal funds rate now stands at 2.5 percent, or slightly less than the inflation rate, and there is no reason to think the Fed is finished slashing. Jeffrey Applegate, chief U.S. market strategist at Lehman Brothers, figures we could get down to 1.5 percent to 2 percent short-term rates by sometime next year, the lowest level since the late 1950s. At the same time, Congress is brewing up an incentive package of tax cuts and spending programs that should add further fuel to the economic fire.</br></br>Applegate notes that in every recession since 1950, the market rebounded before the economy did, driven by the combined effects of rate cuts, falling inflation and, in some cases, tax cuts. ""The key variable for the stock market is how much stimulus does the market think is in the pipeline,"" he said. ""And the truth is there's a lot, with more to come."""
"The threat of U.S. jobs heading abroad has become such a potent campaign issue this year that congressional Democrats are moving quickly to capitalize on it -- and to use it against Republicans.</br></br>Democratic leaders are pushing a package of hefty corporate tax increases intended to discourage businesses from moving their operations overseas. They have attached the proposed increases to a bill that would extend unemployment benefits and tax breaks to businesses, all but daring GOP lawmakers to vote against it.</br></br>Republicans and their allies in the business community say the effort, pending in the Senate, could backfire. They say it will slow the recovery and inflict more pain on American workers. But with unemployment hovering close to 10 percent, Democrats are using whatever legislative tactics they can think of to demonstrate leadership on the economy before the Nov. 2 midterm elections.</br></br>""It's not rocket science,"" said Eddie Vale, a spokesman for the AFL-CIO. ""People are unemployed, or their brother is, or their next-door neighbor is. If Democrats want to win races in 2010, they need to show people they're creating jobs for them. And repealing tax breaks that send jobs overseas is a direct corollary.""</br></br>At issue are nine corporate tax changes in the American Jobs and Closing Tax Loopholes Act of 2010, approved by the House on May 28 and introduced in a modified form Tuesday in the Senate. The provisions would alter long-standing laws on overseas income intended to prevent U.S. companies from facing double taxation. Together, they would raise an estimated $14 billion over 10 years."
"Credit-card issuers, faced with a saturated market for new card holders, are resorting to stealing customers from one another, turning an already competitive industry into a fight to survive.</br></br>After the early success of American Telephone & Telegraph Co.'s recent ""balance-transfer"" promotion, a growing number of issuers are offering similiar programs; under them, existing and prospective card holders are offered lower interest rates or other incentives to transfer balances outstanding on other credit cards. The promotion is offered only to those who keep a balance outstanding on their credit cards. In effect, card issuers are trying to steal market share from competitors by enticing customers to transfer their card debt.</br></br>In all, the number of issuers that are now promoting a balance-transfer program has nearly tripled to 220 from 84 a year ago, according to RAM Research Corp., Frederick, Md., which tracks rates and fees of 536 credit-card issuers. There were only a few issuers with such a program two years ago.</br></br>The growth of such programs is good news for consumers, who can expect to see interest rates fall even more. But it could spell trouble for the credit-card industry, which is likely to see profit margins shrink and some issuers forced out of the business.</br></br>""What it spells is lower profits for issuers,"" says Spencer Nilson, publisher of the Nilson Report, an industry newsletter in Santa Monica, Calif. ""It also spells more consolidations, with stronger issuers buying up weaker ones."""
"A husband, father and entrepreneur with more responsibilities than he cares to count, Marshall Lane is happy to see his pile of bills getting shorter as he hacks away at credit-card debt.</br></br>In 1996, Mr. Lane and his wife, Jannicke Kolderup-Lane, carried a combined credit-card balance of ""about $20,000."" Three years later, that balance has been cut in half. ""We're at a point where we could pay it off if we wanted to,"" said the 31-year-old San Francisco art dealer.</br></br>He may not know it, but Mr. Lane -- and others like him -- is beginning to demonstrate a new level of prudence in personal finance that could have broad implications for the U.S. economy.</br></br>For years, economists warned that a high level of consumer debt was the Achilles' heel of an otherwise athletic economy. Overextended consumers, they pointed out, would be forced to use an ever-growing share of household income to pay credit-card bills, leaving little to support consumer spending. And if consumer spending slowed, they bemoaned, so would the economy.</br></br>Yet in recent months, the statistics on the consumer debt front have shown signs of improvement. The pace of new debt has slowed significantly, delinquencies and charge-off rates are falling sharply and the amount of revolving credit outstanding declined in the first quarter. Reducing credit-card debt, say economists, could be the first step to raising the U.S.'s low rates of saving."
"COLA is creeping back.</br></br>The percentage of unionized workers covered by cost-of-living-adjustment clauses, which had declined in recent years, is rising again as inflation heats up. What's more, many observers expect that this year's higher inflation rate will move COLA clauses back onto the bargaining table. And existing COLA clauses are starting to be worth more in labor contracts.</br></br>""Generally, if the Consumer Price Index is going up, it will be a topic in more and more settlements. Workers would like some compensation in addition to wages,"" says Fehmida Sleemi, an economist with the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</br></br>Higher inflation also means bigger COLA payouts, especially in cases where payouts begin only after inflation hits a certain level. Last year, payouts under cost-of-living clauses made up 26% of overall union wage increases, compared with 16% of such payouts in 1987. This year, that figure is likely to rise.</br></br>Over the past three years, a typical COLA clause that provided for a one-cent-an-hour increase for every 0.3% increase in the CPI would have yielded a total of $1.05 an hour. Over the next three years, assuming that inflation rises an average of 4.8% a year, that same COLA clause would yield $1.76 an hour. The calculations are based on changes in the CPI, which uses 1967 as a base of 100. That figure stood at 354.3 at the end of 1988."
"The Bush administration says proudly in Its 1991 budget proposals that it will have eliminated the budget deficit by 1993, but the Congressional Budget Office said yesterday that the president‰Ûªs math is off by about $94 billion.</br></br>Using more pessimistic economic assumptions, the CBO, the research arm of Congress, said the Bush administration's proposals for cutting the federal deficit would fall far short of the measures required to balance the budget as is required by law.</br></br>The administration has projected that its proposals will produce a surplus that year, but the CBO said the president's budget uses overly optimistic assumptions about economic growth and interest rates. The CBO said the president‰Ûªs proposals would not result in a significant cut in the deficit until fiscal 1995.</br></br>Economic experts increasingly are pointing to the budget deficit, and its seaulting drain on the nation‰Ûªs resources, as a major reason for a variety of economic ills ranging from Bee CBO, 1)7, Cot 1 (n the short term, the CM) said in Its annual analysis of the administration‰Ûªs proposed budget, the Hush budget cuts were substantial. It said, however, that its own economic assumptions would boost the estimated deficit by $2(> billion in fiscal 1991 alone.</br></br>In addition, the estimates by the CBO excluded the cost of the bailout of the ailing savings and loan industry. The office said that by 1992 the administration would need at least $25 billion to $30 billion more than it has projected to cover net losses involved in rescuing savings and loan institutions."
"THE DOW JONES Industrial Average bypassed its high within minutes of the market open, then again near the close, but trimmed its gains to finish shy of the record.</br></br>The indicator, which tracks 30 blue-chip companies, posted an intraday high of 11728.46, up 5.48 points from its January 2000 peak. But on the day, the Dow industrials finished up 29.21 points, or 0.29%, at 11718.45, up 9.3% on the year.</br></br>Among the Dow average's strongest components were Caterpillar and General Motors. GM rose after Kirk Kerkorian's Tracinda, which owns 9.9% of GM's shares outstanding, said it was considering purchasing as many as 12 million more shares of the auto maker. Tracinda also said it supports an alliance between GM and Renault-Nissan.</br></br>However, the three names with the biggest influence weightings in the price-weighted Dow industrial average -- International Business Machines, Altria Group and Boeing -- all finished the day off less than 0.5%. Even modest gains at one or two of those companies would have sent the Dow industrial average over its record, which now stands just 4.53 points away, at 11722.98.</br></br>""The Dow is teasing everybody right now,"" said Kenneth Tower, chief market strategist at the online-brokerage firm CyberTrader."
"This is a tale of two cities. Each is the seat of an empire, one built around political power, the other around entertainment. The 'tologist can tell you all about it because he's just back from L.A., which gives him the opportunity to say, repeatedly, ""I just flew in from the Coast."" (Of course no one on the Coast actually calls it the Coast. You have to not be on the Coast, or have any real knowledge of the Coast, to call it the Coast. Same with Frisco and the Big Apple.)</br></br>If cities have an organic quality then Washington is a flower, the District a monumental pistil, heavily dusted with the pollen of modern city life, the Potomac a stem from which everything rises, the suburbs arrayed like petals, simple and lovely if somewhat repetitive.</br></br>This is not to insult Los Angeles. In fact it can be a beautiful, mesmerizing place, which is one reason why upward of 10 million people live there. Los Angeles has big mountains, palm trees, good-looking people, beaches. One day I drove up to Point Dume and walked along the bluffs, the Santa Monica Mountains tumbling into the sea, seals swimming in the clear blue water, sea birds soaring on the updrafts. Someone was surfcasting, barefoot on the beach. Hardly anyone else was around. It was a Saturday morning; if you were in Washington and had gone to Sugarloaf Mountain on a sunny day like this you'd have found hundreds of people, acres of children scrambling around - mall meets mountain. But in Los Angeles there are mountain ranges in every direction, there's even a range right in town, the Hollywood Hills, and so people are spoiled. Their attitude toward nature is like that of a Washingtonian who sees the Lincoln Memorial every day but never goes there.</br></br>So, yes, Los Angeles and its surroundings can be lovely, but they can also feel post-apocalyptic. Washington is still basically pre-apocalyptic, except for Democratic Hill staffers. Washington never has serious recessions, because government is incapable of doing anything but grow, and we don't have natural disasters, which happen in Los Angeles continually to the point where everyone walks around in this Death Is My Companion daze. Insanely they have built a city atop a piece of the Earth's crust that is fractured like a broken windshield. It's hard for anyone to be deeply serious about anything in Los Angeles, since they know that in a couple of hours they'll fall into a jagged crevice in the Earth's surface, never to be seen again. The typical Washington disaster? It snows some. That and term limits.</br></br>Washington has history, a deep sense of its place in the creation of a nation. It's been here at least since the late 1800s, if memory serves. But in Los Angeles everything is new, disposable, with the texture of things not meant to age. Half a century ago Raymond Chandler wrote great stories about a private eye tooling around town finding bodies and getting beat up. If Chandler were still alive he'd have to have entire chapters about Philip Marlowe getting stuck in traffic. You can imagine the prose: ""I was headed for Bay City to eyeball a stiff. I turned off Melrose and took the 101 to the Harbor Freeway. It was a parking lot. The world had stopped. I put my feet up on the dash and read the funny pages. Something caught the corner of my eye, a flash of white in the HOV lane. Teeth. A blonde in a purring red Porsche. Her lipstick was the color of aortic blood. She smiled hugely. Her mouth was more than flesh and bone, it was a geological formation. She gave me a look I could feel in my hip beeper. I put the car in neutral and pressed down on the gas. She got the message."""
"Anytime the consumer price index goes up, as the government reported it did last month, some financial analysts immediately worry that the Federal Reserve will respond by boosting short-term interest rates.</br></br>In fact, many Fed officials, including Chairman Alan Greenspan, usually pay more attention to what is happening to costs that could push inflation up in the future - than to recent changes in prices.</br></br>The numbers Fed officials monitor most closely are those on labor costs, because for most businesses they are the biggest cost item by far. For the average business, wages paid to employees and the cost of fringe benefits represent more than 70 percent of all expenses. The labor statistic that economists follow most closely is ""unit labor costs,"" which tracks the labor cost of each unit produced, and thus reflects any labor-saving productivity gains.</br></br>The chart at right shows how closely consumer price inflation has tracked changes in unit labor costs since 1980. It also indicates why so many analysts think inflation will remain subdued for some time to come: Unit labor costs are low and give no sign of accelerating.</br></br>In the 12 months that ended in September, businesses other than farms increased worker compensation an average of 3.2 percent, according to the Labor Department. But productivity gains - increases in the amount of goods and services produced for each hour worked - of 1.4 percent meant that firms' unit labor costs rose only 1.8 percent."
"The Commerce Department, freed from a nine-year-old legal restriction originally enacted by Congress to make initial reports of the nation's trade deficit look bigger, next week begins to publish figures in a way that will appear to make the deficit smaller.</br></br>In recent years, changes in the monthly merchandise trade deficit sometimes have had a major affect on the stock market, long-term interest rates and the value of the dollar. Investors now will be able to react to two different measures of the deficit, which will be published simultaneously.</br></br>The difference, expected to take about $1.5 billion off each month's merchandise trade deficit, will be on the import side of the ledger. Since 1979, the department's Census Bureau has been required by law to include not only the value of goods shipped from abroad in the initial trade reports, but also the cost of insuring and transporting the goods.</br></br>Insurance and freight charges -- which are services, not goods -- are not added to the value of exports. This makes the difference between exports and imports, which is the deficit in goods trade, look higher than it really is.</br></br>Before 1979, the Census Bureau simultaneously published figures for imports on a customs-value basis, with just the value of the goods included, and also on a cost-insurance-freight basis."
"Tokyo -- JAPAN'S NEW central bank chief, who takes office tomorrow, could immediately face his first test -- bracing his country's economy against the shock of a U.S.-led war in Iraq. But the crisis also could offer incoming Governor Toshihiko Fukui an unexpected opportunity to fight an enemy closer to home: deflation.</br></br>Mr. Fukui takes the helm of the central bank of the world's second-largest economy on the same day as the U.S. deadline for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. War fears have helped to drive Japan's stocks to 20-year lows, threatening banks and other corporations with losses just weeks before the fiscal year ends March 31.</br></br>Yesterday, in his first public questioning in the Japanese Parliament, Mr. Fukui signaled a readiness to take emergency liquidity-boosting measures similar to those of his predecessor, Masaru Hayami, following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. At that time, the Bank of Japan injected more than two trillion yen ($16.88 billion) into money markets in less than two hours, then pumped trillions more into money and currency markets during the next several weeks.</br></br>The BOJ ""must get into war mode,"" Mr. Fukui told lawmakers. ""If war breaks out, we must prevent an excessive shock to the market.""</br></br>Yet opening the yen floodgates during a Middle East crisis could also offer the 67-year-old Mr. Fukui an opportunity to attack the deflationary pressures that have contributed to Japan's long-running economic funk, economists say. Mr. Fukui could continue a war-driven, expansionist monetary policy even after war subsides, effectively letting him back into a looser stance without seeming to break completely with past bank policy."
"PhyCor Inc. and MedPartners Inc. called off their proposed $6.25 billion merger, blaming ""significant operational and strategic differences."" At the same time, MedPartners said it expects to take two large charges in the fourth quarter and possibly to report a quarterly loss from continuing operations.</br></br>From the beginning, the planned combination of the two large physician management companies -- which stunned Wall Street when it was announced last October -- was greeted with skepticism by the Street. Almost immediately, the stock prices of both companies began to falter as analysts suggested that uniting the disparate cultures would be difficult. Yesterday, PhyCor, Nashville, Tenn., rose 12.5 cents to $26.50 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. MedPartners, Birmingham, Ala., fell 76.5625 cents to $18.1719 in composite Big Board trading. The merger plans were called off after the market closed.</br></br>The merged company, which would have brought together the nation's two largest physician-management companies, would have had affiliations with about 35,000 doctors, or 5% of the country's physicians, and would have generated annual revenue of about $8 billion. Last fall, the companies heralded the deal as a way to put doctors on a level playing field with hospitals and health-maintenance organizations. Cost savings from economies of scale were also expected.</br></br>Nevertheless, the differences proved insurmountable. ""Each company takes a much different approach to business in a number of key areas, including information systems, development, and operations,"" Joseph C. Hutts, PhyCor's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. In an interview, Mr. Hutts said the deal unraveled over about a week's time. He declined to specify the differences that led to the dissolution. He said the two companies agreed not to elaborate beyond the prepared statement.</br></br>""The differences were quite significant,"" Larry House, MedPartners chairman and CEO, said in an interview. He also declined to elaborate, saying only that the clashes involved the business operations and the corporate cultures."

"RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. boosted the wholesale prices of most of its cigarette brands by about 4%, raising the retail per-pack price by an estimated four to five cents. Analysts said the company appeared to be capitalizing on the steadily growing demand for premium cigarettes in an attempt to improve its earnings performance.</br></br>Tobacco companies have raised prices periodically over the past few years; RJR, following the industry, raised prices by the same increment in April 1996. Cigarette prices are still below 1993 levels, when Philip Morris Cos. slashed the price of its premium brands on a day that came to be known as ""Marlboro Friday.""</br></br>RJR spokeswoman Maura Ellis said the New York food and tobacco holding company announced late Thursday that effective immediately it was raising its price to wholesalers by $2 for 1000 cigarettes for Camel, Winston and all other principal brands except Century, which was raised by $1.60 for 1000. That increase also amounts to about four cents a pack because the packs have additional cigarettes. She attributed the rise to ""the increased cost of doing business.""</br></br>Philip Morris, of New York, and Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., a subsidiary of B.A.T Industries PLC of Britain, declined to comment on their rival's pricing move. Analysts offered mixed predictions on the likelihood that Philip Morris, the market leader, would respond by raising prices right away, and said Brown & Williamson may wait to act after Philip Morris.</br></br>People close to the industry said the Loews Corp.'s Lorillard Inc. subsidiary and Liggett, a unit of Brooke Group Ltd., responded by also increasing their prices by $2 for 1000. Officials at both companies couldn't be reached for comment Sunday."
"Business Mood</br></br>May Give Fed</br></br>Leeway to Cut</br></br>Market turmoil has lots of investors betting the Federal Reserve will come to the rescue in the months ahead with interest-rate cuts to boost the economy. The Fed says its bigger concern is still the prospect of inflation, which weighs against interest-rate cuts.</br></br>That makes today's Labor Department report on consumer-price inflation in July especially important. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones estimate the consumer-price index was up a scant 0.1% in July and the core consumer-price index, which doesn't count volatile food and energy prices, was up 0.2%."
"During the campaign, Jimmy Carter spoke on practically every subject in. this world, and a few in the next. But not‰ÛÓat least not in a systematic way-on inflation.</br></br>The major speech prepared on inflation was never given, and an eight-point program based on the speech and' released on the campaign plane was almost universally ignored. So it is not surprising that businessmen are nervous and there is a tendency to see a collision shaping up between the President-elect and the sagacious chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Arthur Burns.</br></br>But in fact an analysis of the original speech shows that Carter takes the inflationary problem seriously indeed. It seems equally clear that Mr. Burns, far from seeking a shoot-out with the new administration, is moving toward a position of accommodation.</br></br>The basic premise of the original speech prepared for Carter is that inflation is a deadly serious problem. ‰ÛÏCurbing the disease of inflation will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next President of the United States,‰Û is its opening line. The speech further says: ‰ÛÏInflation has been a national disaster. It has deprived the American peo-, pie and, indeed, the whole world of the</br></br>reliance on the soundness of the dollar that is so vital to our economic system. ,'It has destroyed the value of hard-earned pay increases... forced people to... lower their standard of living... defrauded the small saver... imposed a huge human toll."" The slow-growth policy of the Ford administration for dealing with inflation was, of course, rejected because it cost so much in unemployment and underused productive capacity. Instead, the speech proposed an eight-point program for dealing directly with inflation in a way that would not diminish employment or slow down economic growth. The eight points were as follows:"
"WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State George Shultz was convinced it was the perfect time to hold Israel's feet to the fire.</br></br>President Reagan, flush with a massive reelection victory and knowing he wouldn't be facing the voters again, would be insulated from political pressure. Even some of Israel's staunchest supporters agreed that harsh medicine was needed.</br></br>So Secretary Shultz pushed to withhold emergency economic aid until the Jewish state imposed a credible austerity plan to get its chaotic economy in order. The U.S. wanted quick action on huge budget cuts and other swift steps to curb Israel's runaway inflation. In exchange, the U.S. would inject as much as $1.5 billion in emergency aid to bolster Israel's sinking currency reserves.</br></br>But like other secretaries of state before him, Mr. Shultz is learning that when trying to hold Israel's feet to the fire, most of the heat is felt by the administration.</br></br>Only two months after the Reagan administration's plan was launched, members of Congress began tripping over themselves in a bipartisan rush to tell President Reagan to back off. A half-dozen influential senators warned Secretary Shultz that ""continuation of an exercise in economic brinkmanship -- or 'chicken' if you will -- may soon become counterproductive."" House members followed with a similar warning, linking Israel's stability to U.S. strategic interests and pointing out that Israel has taken certain austerity steps."
"Business is booming at the Bank of Mom and Dad.</br></br>As banks have tightened lending standards, growing numbers of families are stepping into the breach. But while intrafamily loans can yield significant financial rewards for lenders and borrowers, families must carefully assess the risks.</br></br>While many families handle the process in informal oral agreements, advisers urge clients to document such loans in written contracts, just as a bank would. This can also make it easier for families to comply with tax rules that require lenders to pay income tax on the interest they receive and allow borrowers with mortgages to deduct the interest payments they pay.</br></br>Some families choose to go through websites like Prosper and Lending Club, which match lenders and borrowers online--though they also set minimum interest rates.</br></br>For the borrowers--often adult children--the advantages of these loans may include access to below-market interest rates and easier repayment terms than a bank might offer."
"The Federal Reserve‰Ûªs light-money policy is now a full year old, but not even Ihose responsible for Its birth feel like celebrating the anniversary.</br></br>It was on Dec. 17, 1008, that the 12-memher, pollcy-aettlng Open Market Committee of the ‰ÛÏFed"" voted to yank hard on the credit reins to kick off a determined push to curb inflation. The committee revised its directive to the policy-executing New York district bank to call for conducting future operations ‰ÛÏwith a view to attaining firmer conditions ... In the credit markets.‰Û</br></br>Thus began one of the most drastic hold-downs on money-supply growth in (he nation's history. The mid-December action-was later supplemented by increases in the discount rate at which banks borrow from the Fed, by higher reserve requirements on bank deposits (leaving less cash free for lending), and by further buying and selling of securities in the open market to drain off funds and produce even tighter conditions.</br></br>The year that has followed has defied many theories and forecasts. Working in tandem with a tight budget policy, the Fed‰Ûªs policy in the past 12 months has brought a set of developments‰ÛÓsome quite painful‰ÛÓthat few dreamed of as 1969 was approaching. For example: drained the banks of their ready, lend-able cash‰ÛÓtheir so-called liquidity‰ÛÓand forced them tp scour European money markets for funds to meet loan commitments previously contracted for.

"Looser corporate-governance standards are luring foreign companies to U.S. markets, a development causing concern among some large investors.</br></br>Overseas companies like Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. have recently opted to list their shares in New York rather than in their home markets or on other international exchanges, in part because the U.S. in some respects is more lenient, people familiar with the matter say.</br></br>Unlike venues in London and Hong Kong, their main rivals in the race for global listings, the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market allow corporate insiders who collectively own less than half their companies' stock to exercise control through dual-share structures and other means. In addition, many foreign companies are exempted from some of the disclosure requirements imposed on U.S. corporations.</br></br>""If you're looking to do dual-class, the U.S. is where you can do that,"" said Alex Cohen, a former Securities and Exchange Commission official who is now a partner at law firm Latham & Watkins LLP. ""That's certainly a draw for some companies.""</br></br>So far this year, at least 15 foreign companies have filed papers in preparation for initial public offerings in the U.S., according to a search of securities filings, with most likely to trade on Nasdaq or the NYSE. That puts 2014 on track to be the busiest year for such filings since at least 1996--though the increase in activity comes amid a broader pickup in IPOs, with firms listing at the fastest rate in years."
"The U.S. trade deficit surged to $48 billion from July through September, the worst quarterly performance in history, as American exports fell for the first time in three years.</br></br>The U.S. current account is the broadest measure of foreign trade, tracking not only sales of goods but also services, investment flows and foreign aid.</br></br>The trade performance reflected a small increase of 0.7 percent in merchandise imports, which rose to $201.5 billion during the third quarter. At the same time, U.S. merchandise exports fell 2.1 percent to $149.9 billion, marking the first quarterly setback in U.S. merchandise ex-</br></br>Also yesterday, a new survey showed that purchasing managers are more optimistic about the economy than they were a year ago, seeing no discernible inflation and a modest increase in employment next year.</br></br>Seventy-one percent of managers who buy supplies for U.S. manufacturers expect business to improve, the National Association of Purchasing Management said yesterday in a semiannual forecast."
"The stock market in the third quarter slapped down investors who failed to heed this year's profit lesson: Buy stocks, not industry groups.</br></br>Just look at auto makers. Because the three stocks soared in the first half, many investors hopped on for a third-quarter jaunt. Instead, the group slammed into reverse. Autos finished dead last among 96 industries in the Dow Jones Equity Market Index, which rose 2.7% in the quarter.</br></br>But while General Motors slumped 27% and Ford slid 13.6%, Chrysler rose 9.5%.</br></br>The auto makers' third-quarter performances underscore some important trends that, analysts say, are expected to extend into the fourth quarter. First, stocks that are tied to the economic cycle, such as autos, generally fared worse than stocks that tend to maintain earnings in weak economic conditions. As investors grew increasingly disheartened about the pace of the U.S. recovery, they boosted their purchases of defensive stocks such as cosmetics and tobacco.</br></br>Second, though some sectors like autos performed poorly on the whole, individual stocks such as Chrysler proved resilient. Analysts say that in the current economic climate, careful stock selection is far wiser than sector-wide investing."
"BRUSSELS -- The world's seven major industrialized countries should meet soon to discuss ""the present deterioration of the world economy"" and the unusual disparity between U.S. and German interest rates, according to the head of the International Monetary Fund.</br></br>Economic growth is slowing, and ""the world economy is at a turning point,"" Michel Camdessus, the IMF's managing director, said. He stressed the need for more discussion between the finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven industrialized countries: the U.S., Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.</br></br>Mr. Camdessus also urged trade ministers to reach a successful conclusion to their four-year trade talks, which are in their final week here. He said failure of the talks would be ""extremely damaging"" to IMF efforts to devise economic-reform programs in many countries, and would hurt both the industrialized and developing worlds.</br></br>In recent weeks, the French finance minister, Pierre Beregovoy, twice has sought U.S. support for a Group of Seven meeting. The U.S. Treasury so far hasn't publicly responded to these requests, although some U.S. officials point out that a G-7 gathering generally is held early each year -- in January or February.</br></br>""I'd be surprised if we didn't have {a G-7 meeting} soon,"" said Charles Dallara, the assistant U.S. treasury secretary for international affairs."
"FASTER ECONOMIC GROWTH finally brings some cheer to many states.</br></br>As the economy perks up, tax collectors report higher revenues. State revenue, even excluding tax increases, rose faster than inflation in the third quarter, says the Center for the Study of the States in Albany, N.Y. That was the first time this has happened in any quarter since late 1990. Oregon and Utah posted especially strong gains. Total state revenue rose 4.3%, without tax-law changes, up from sluggish second-quarter growth of 2.6% and anemic first-quarter growth of 1%.</br></br>But growth generally remains ""far from robust,"" says Steven Gold, the center's director, and many states remain depressed. The mid-Atlantic region posted the smallest improvement, and California's budget woes worry bond investors. This year, fewer states raised taxes than last year. Total third-quarter state revenue, including tax increases, rose 7.6%, down from second-quarter growth of 8.9%.</br></br>Ohio, facing an estimated $300 million deficit, may increase taxes soon, an aide to Gov.

"NEW YORK -- In the wake of the biggest year ever in takeovers, some major deals are running into trouble.</br></br>For example, an R.H. Macy & Co. management group that wants to take the big retailer private cut its price on its proposed $3.6 billion buyout. Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co. wants to do the same with its proposed $6.2 billion buyout of Beatrice Cos.</br></br>Carl C. Icahn had to scuttle his plans to complete a planned merger with Trans World Airlines after he couldn't finance the original deal. And Turner Broadcasting System Inc.'s planned $1.5 billion acquisition of MGM/UA Entertainment Co. is in trouble, too.</br></br>All these transactions are being financed with large issues of high-yield, low-rated ""junk"" securities. All but the Macy deal depend on financing to be raised by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the investment banking firm that dominates the junk-bond market.</br></br>Leon D. Black, a managing director and co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Drexel, insists that the spate of deal restructurings isn't a trend. The market for takeover deals is ""very healthy,"" he says, and the restructurings are caused by factors unique to each one."
"High interest rates are the stick that drove Congress and the White House to negotiate all spring over the budget and that may yet push Congress to take some action to reduce the upcoming deficit.</br></br>The theory is that lower prospective deficits will reduce pressure on the financial markets, reduce fear of future inflation, and for both reasons bring a reduction in interest rates that will let the economy off the floor of recession.</br></br>All sides agree that high interest rates are a leading cause of the economy‰Ûªs problems. But there is lively disagreement about the rest of the equation: just what is keeping rates high now, and how best to bring them down without harming the economy in other ways.</br></br>President Reagan has himself been afflicted by this split in opinion. Thus he has said that the likely deficits over the next several years are keeping rates high, in part because they are raising inflationary expectations and leaving investors unwilling to lend except at extremely high rates. But he has also taken a contrary view and, citing cases in the Midwest where local banks have cut their rates, has argued that interest rates should come down because the inflation rate has come down so rquch in recent months.</br></br>There are several lines of argument against the interest rate theory on which the budget negotiators have been operating."
"Author: Justin Lahart</br></br>A sustained and significant rise in oil prices could derail the U.S. economic recovery by stirring inflation and putting the brakes on spending.</br></br>Oil futures touched $100 a barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange Wednesday--the highest since before the financial crisis hit in late 2008--before pulling back. Pricier oil drives up the costs of everything from gas at the pump to the raw materials used to make nylon and food packaging. That could mean higher inflation and prompt consumers, who lately have shown more willingness to spend, to cut back their purchases.</br></br>Oil prices have risen 7.35% since the beginning of the year, while gasoline futures have risen 10.67%.</br></br>The question now is whether turmoil in the Middle East and Northern Africa could lead to a sustained cutback in production or delivery disruptions that could drive those prices much higher and push the U.S. as well as other countries back into recession. Supply-driven oil shocks, like the ones that came with the 1973 oil embargo and the 1979 Iranian revolution, were factors in past recessions."
"No one bothers to plant trees or flowers in this blight on the harsh Red Desert. Trailer homes line the sad, barren streets -- ready to be hitched up and hauled away at any time. The gravel roads are a symbol of impermanence in a boomtown so temporary many of the men who live here left their families back home.</br></br>""This is about the worst, ugliest city I've ever seen in my life,"" declared Shawn Klein, a gas field worker who had just pulled into town from the Black Hills in South Dakota.</br></br>The fields surrounding Wamsutter are sprinkled with thousands of natural gas wells, and new workers arrive every day, eager for big paydays.</br></br>But pessimism hangs over Wamsutter like the blanket of smoke in the town's only bar.

"Senate legislation setting a 4.8 percent military raise for next January is almost certain to include language urging the same raise for 1.2 million white-collar federal workers.</br></br>Although it is tough to compare federal civilian and military pay (because of various allowances accorded military personnel), both groups work for the same employer and generally get raises at the same time each year. But they don't always receive the same percentage amounts.</br></br>Raises for civilian and military personnel are based on different political, economic and strategic considerations. That means one group is often playing pay catch-up with the other.</br></br>Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John W. Warner (R-Va.) has military pay on a legislative fast track. The bill would move separately from -- and ahead of -- the much larger defense authorization bill.</br></br>But Warner, with strong bipartisan support, wants the pay raise issue dealt with fast and first. He has agreed to include language promising pay-raise equity from a non-binding resolution by Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.)."
"Despite being on track to offer some of the lowest yields in history, this week's auctions of $66 billion in Treasury securities are likely to get strong demand because investors expect new Federal Reserve stimulus that will keep yields under pressure.</br></br>""These auctions are going to go very well,"" said Eric Green, chief U.S. rates strategist at TD Securities. ""The path of least resistance is lower yields, and there is every reason to believe that perception of the Fed doing something will persist up to the [Fed's September] meeting.""</br></br>Mr. Green said it wouldn't be surprising to see the benchmark 10-year Treasury note's yield fall toward 1.5% this year. It ended at a record low 1.917% late Friday, down from 1.986% Thursday and 2.000% a week earlier. Yields move inversely to prices.</br></br>The Treasury is scheduled to sell $32 billion in three-year notes Monday, $21 billion in 10-year notes Tuesday and $13 billion in 30-year bonds Wednesday.</br></br>Also, the euro zone's deteriorating sovereign-debt crisis is expected to help keep demand high for U.S. government debt."
"Shares of Media Vision Technology Inc., a once-highflying maker of video and sound accessories for computers, fell 48.8% after the company said it expects to post a ""substantial loss"" for the first quarter.</br></br>The loss will stem partly from reducing prices on certain of its retail products in response to aggressive price-cutting by the competition.</br></br>The Fremont, Calif., company also said shipment of one of its new multimedia products would be delayed into the second quarter, resulting in a significant drop in revenue for the first quarter.</br></br>The company would not comment beyond a terse news release, which provided no details on which products were involved in the price cuts or shipment delay. Paul Jain, president and chief executive officer, was not available for comment.</br></br>The slide to $11 a share, down $10.50 Nasdaq Stock Market trading, came after Media Vision shares had already tumbled precipitously in recent weeks, following the release of fourth-quarter results showing a growing backlog of unsold products. The one-time Wall Street darling had seen its share value rocket to a December high of $43.75 from $20.25 when it first went public in 1992. From its zenith, Media Vision has lost about $500 million in market capitalization."

"DIVIDEND-PAYING stocks are already on a roll, and the Bush administration's plan to cut individual taxes on dividends would give them another boost.</br></br>While reaction on Wall Street was muted yesterday because of the plan's uncertain future, several details emerged. At a minimum, an administration plan would likely provide tax relief for dividends not only on common stock but on preferred stock as well. Dividends passed on to holders of mutual funds, often in the form of additional shares of the fund, would also get taxed less. However, dividends paid by many small and family-owned businesses probably wouldn't be affected.</br></br>For investors, the likely inclusion of preferred stock is welcome news. Preferred stock, while technically stock, carries a high dividend and functions almost like a bond in people's portfolios, providing a steady stream of regular income. While preferred stock is often held by institutions, reducing the tax would spur more individual investors to buy it -- especially given its large dividends.</br></br>Proposals are being floated in Washington about how best to accomplish the administration's goals. One approach is eliminating the dividend tax altogether. Another would reduce the tax rate on dividends to equal that on capital gains, typically 20%. Currently, dividend payments are taxed at ordinary income rates, as high as 38.6%. Yet a third possibility would exempt some amount of dividends, say, $1,000, from taxes.</br></br>If the proposal becomes law, corporations would come under increasing pressure to change their approach to dividends. Companies that already have dividends would be pushed to boost them. And companies that have never paid dividends, such as Microsoft, Dell Computer and Cisco Systems, would face pressure to start paying them."

"Is living alone passe?</br></br>That's what the latest annual statistics on U.S. households suggest.</br></br>For the first time since the mid-1960s, the growth in non-family households -- mainly singles -- came to a virtual halt this year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's latest Current Population Survey. In the 1970s, the number of such households soared 77.7%, five times the rise in family households.</br></br>""It's pretty amazing,"" says Peter Francese, president of American Demographics magazine. ""Most demographic trends don't disappear that quickly.""</br></br>One year's statistic doesn't always portend a trend, and young adults are still much more likely to live alone today than they were a generation ago. Still, the rise in single-member households has been slowing since the early 1980s, when there was a recession. That's when many newly jobless young adults moved back with Mom and Dad."
"THE BUDGET deficit is still much too large, and in theory this is the perfect time to reduce it further, while the economy is strengthening and before it overheats. But the president and the Democratic Congress have given themselves time off this year from conventional deficit reduction in favor of health care reform. That adds to the urgency of producing a reform that (a) is affordable - no frills - (b) is solidly financed and (c) includes a credible means of containing costs. If they fail to produce such a plan, they will face a serious fiscal problem next year as well as an unsolved health care problem.</br></br>The economy was in a more uncertain state than now when the president decided last winter to take the year off in terms of deficit reduction. The uncertainty provided a rationale: The need to take care - having already cut the deficit substantially the year before - not to take a second step in the same direction that might choke off the recovery. The president and many congressional Democrats wanted the year off anyway. They have a lot else on their agenda than simply reducing the deficit, which is no one's idea of fun.</br></br>But the decision to shift from the deficit to health care this year was not a dodge or gimmick. It was, and still is, defensible in fiscal as well as programmatic terms. Health care costs are the rogue item in the federal budget, just as they are in every other budget in the country. If left to themselves they will drive up future deficits almost no matter what else Congress does. They have to be contained, nor does it do much good if Congress, in containing them, merely shifts them to the states or private payers. That's a hidden tax increase if ever there was one.</br></br>Almost all the reform plans now in play would increase national (not just federal) spending on health care in the short run by increasing the number of people who are insured. In the longer run, however, a plan that is any good will appreciably reduce projected spending and the pressure on the budget.</br></br>That should be the goal. It was the stated goal when the president introduced his plan. If he and Congress prove incapable of achieving it, here is what they will likely face next year."

"This crowded territory of 5 million Chinese, famous for forsaking all ideologies except pursuit of financial gain, is so aflame with political passions stimulated by the student demonstrations in Beijing that plans for a smooth reunification with China in 1997 now seem in jeopardy.</br></br>The Hang Seng index, the key barometer of the Hong Kong stock market, plummeted 339 points today, a loss of about 11 percent of total value. It was the sharpest drop in the market since the 1987 world stock panic and a strong indication that continued political instability in Beijing could seriously weaken the Hong Kong economy and force a crippling exodus of investors.</br></br>On Sunday, nearly a half-million Hong Kong residents supporting the Chinese democracy movement jammed streets for hours in the biggest political march ever seen here. Two prominent members of the committee drafting a basic law for the city after the planned reunification have resigned in protest of Beijing's handling of the demonstrations, and other members have threatened to follow suit if there were serious violence against students. A local consultative committee working on the basic law suspended its deliberations late today and canceled a meeting with a mainland drafting group.</br></br>""The latest events in China have made Hong Kong people realize that Hong Kong is closely connected with China, and only when there is democracy in China will Hong Kong have a future,"" said Tam Yiu-chung, a member of both the law-drafting panel and the city legislative council.</br></br>A major reassessment here of what has been a relatively trouble-free transition from British to Chinese rule would be a devastating blow to Chinese foreign policy goals. The Deng Xiaoping government in Beijing had considered the negotiated return of the territory taken by Britain in 1841 to be one of its crowning achievements and a key first step in persuading the rival Chinese government on Taiwan to resume ties with the mainland."
"Sung Won Sohn can thank a pair of $250 denim jeans for his top place in The Wall Street Journal's annual U.S. economic-forecasting rankings.</br></br>Earlier in the year Mr. Sohn, economist and chief executive of Hanmi Financial Corp. in Los Angeles, was visiting a California jeans producer whose executives told him they couldn't keep up with demand for high-priced clothing. He figured ""there must be money out there if people are willing to pay that much"" for bluejeans. The insight -- along with reports from other clients that costs were rising -- led Mr. Sohn, 61 years old, to increase his 2005 projection for inflation and to stick with his call for healthy economic growth in the U.S.</br></br>The resulting prediction of growth of about 3.8% for the first three quarters and above-trend inflation of about 3.6% left him ahead of the pack when the results were tabulated. U.S. gross domestic product expanded, on average, at a 3.7% annual rate during the first nine months, and, as of November, the consumer-price index was up 3.5% from a year earlier. Most other economists had forecast lower inflation and a little less growth in 2005. (Preliminary estimates of fourth-quarter growth are slated for later in January.)</br></br>Also among the most accurate were J. Dewey Daane, a retired professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee; Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America in New York; Gail Fosler, chief economist with the Conference Board in New York; and Maria Fiorini Ramirez of MFR Inc., an economic-consulting firm in New York. All five had above-average inflation forecasts, and three of the five had above-average growth forecasts.</br></br>Many forecasters rely on econometric models to come up with forecasts for economic growth, inflation, interest rates and exchange rates. Mr. Sohn finds a little intuition comes in handy, too. ""I talk to people on the ground,"" he says."
"Inflation should remain moderate for the forseeahle future, but it will result in lost output and high unemployment under present government policies, three economists predicted yesterday.</br></br>Inflation should hover between 1 and 6 percent through next year, barring any unexpected shocks, they said in a forecast that is similar to those made by government and other private economists. The forecast was contained in a report written for the liberal think-tank Center for National Policy by Otto Eck-stein, a former member of the Council of Economic Advisers; Robert Gordon of Northwestern University; and Joel Popkin, a former CEA senior economist.</br></br>Attempts at fighting inflation over the past four year have cost $700 billion, or $0,000 lor every American, the report said.</br></br>""Unemployment in excess of 10 percent imposed major social costs on the 12 million immediately affected individuals each month, destroy- ing for many families a sense of economic security, lowering worker selfesteem and making it virtually impossible for the young entrants into the labor force to find employment opportunities worthy of their education,‰Û Eckstein said.</br></br>In addition to the recession, Eckstein said that declining world oil prices, lower farm prices, the strength of the dollar, and slowly rising wages have contributed to the decline of inflation from 13 percent three years ago to less than 4 percent this year."
"Voices is an occasional column that allows wealth managers to address issues of interest to the advisory community. Valerie Porter is the director of the Financial Planning Association's Research and Practice Institute, as well as president of SummitView Financial in Indianapolis.</br></br>In 2012 I started working as a consultant for the Financial Planning Association. FPA was interested in creating a Research and Practice Institute to gather information about practice management for its 23,000 members. There are lots of tools and resources available online for financial planners, but little empirical data regarding how advisory firms are actually run.</br></br>A lot of advisers are great technicians, or great at planning or investments. But many struggle with the business side of their practice. So we created quarterly surveys to ask advisers about the technical aspects of practice management such as their time management and productivity. Our goal is to use the responses from quarterly surveys to identify how advisers can become better business people.</br></br>The first pilot survey was conducted in the fall of 2013. It was designed as a broad baseline study, to get a feel for what's happening in the industry overall as it relates to practice management. We'd hoped to receive 1,000 responses to this first survey, but we received 2,400, which indicated a big interest.</br></br>This inaugural study showed several performance-related gaps. Advisers agreed that effective time management is important to their business success, but that they struggle in this area. For example, most advisers don't have formal practices and systems in place to ensure for efficiency. Additionally, younger advisers and female advisers indicated that they had no access to a formal training system geared specifically toward them and that they would be interested in participating in one."
"President Carter called on the nation‰Ûªs large corporations yesterday to speed up withholding tax payments in an attempt to trim nearly So billion from the budget deficit in fiscal 1981.</br></br>Carter revealed the payment scheme as part of the $615.8 billion budget he sent to Congress.

"SINGAPORE--Singapore's central bank Friday eased monetary policy for the first time in two years, as a worsening global economic outlook threatens to derail the island nation's export-dependant economy.</br></br>The Monetary Authority of Singapore will continue to guide the local currency higher but at a slower pace, effectively putting less emphasis on containing inflation and more on supporting the economy, which is facing stiffer head winds from weakening demand in the U.S. and Europe and a slowdown in China.</br></br>The move came as the government reported the economy posted only meager growth in the third quarter, narrowly avoiding a technical recession. The economy grew at annualized pace of 1.3% in the third quarter from the second--better than the 0.7% forecast by economists but a weak bounce from a contraction of 6.3% in the second quarter.</br></br>""The MAS is clearly dovish on growth and it is also slightly dovish on inflation. We barely escaped recession in the third quarter as most of the growth came from the highly volatile biotech sector. The underlying trend is still for softer growth,"" said Edward Lee, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank.</br></br>Though Friday's data showed more growth than expected in the third quarter, most economists don't plan to revise their full-year estimates. A post-data poll of 10 found the economy is expected to expand 5.1% in 2011. And nine said it's too early to predict what the central bank might do in the next six months as that would depend on events in the U.S. and Europe. One declined to comment."
"SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- George Bush played down the need for any ""radical steps"" to cut the $155 billion federal budget deficit after the election, arguing that ""steady control, steady restraint"" will correct it.</br></br>The Republican presidential nominee insisted he considers deficit reduction important, but his steady-as-you-go prescription suggests he would attach less urgency to assembling any big deficit-reduction package than some lawmakers and business executives would. He suggested that short-term worries about the deficit will be eased as long as the economy is growing and pushing up government revenues.</br></br>""The larger the {economic growth}, the more reasonable it is to stay with projected reduction targets"" for the federal deficit, Mr. Bush said in an interview. ""In other words, if you're making a lot of money you can owe a little more money.""</br></br>Mr. Bush was dismissive of the National Economic Commission, a bipartisan panel that is studying ways to attack the deficit. Many business and political leaders see the commission as providing the political cover necessary for a new president to deal effectively with the deficit problem. But many conservatives worry that commission members will recommend a tax boost as part of a deficit-cutting package.</br></br>""My message to them is very simple: I'm delighted you were willing to make some suggestions but listen to the American people,"" Mr. Bush said. Commission members ""are not elected, and congressmen are and a president is."""
"NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Thursday sold all 29 subprime mortgage bonds on offer in its latest sale from a portfolio of securities acquired from American International Group.</br></br>The securities, held in a legal entity called Maiden Lane II, sold for what the Fed had estimated their fair current value to be, $878.6 million. The debt was part of a clutch of so-called toxic bonds the central bank acquired when it rescued the failing insurer in 2008.</br></br>Market participants said the small number and size of assets on offer helped the Fed to sell out its entire list.</br></br>""To be sure, a lower-dollar list presents a less-challenging hurdle for both buyers and sellers,"" Walter Schmidt, a senior vice president for FTN Financial Capital Markets in Chicago, wrote in a note to clients. ""Still, it was good for the market to see that the entire . . . list traded after such a low hit rate on the previous list.""</br></br>The Fed had been selling bonds with a face value of about $1.5 billion almost each week since April 6, and some market participants have said the process is too drawn out and is depressing prices on all subprime residential mortgage bonds."
"Finally, there is some good news about the U.S. economy.</br></br>After weeks of troubling reports that suggested the U.S. economy stalled at the end of the summer, the Labor Department said nonfarm business productivity grew at an impressive 4% seasonally adjusted annual rate in the third quarter. That was more than double the 1.7% rate of the previous quarter, and a good indication that the underlying potential of the economy remains strong.</br></br>In the 12 months through September, nonfarm productivity grew 5.3%, its fastest rate in 19 years. Economists have attributed the gains to increased efficiencies from computers and the Internet, as well as the fact that employees that remain after a wave of layoffs tend to be more skilled. Although labor costs are rising, output is rising more than enough to compensate.</br></br>Such strong productivity doesn't necessarily change the short-term economic outlook, which remains somewhat gloomy. But it does suggest that corporate profits will continue to improve and that inflation will remain in check -- both of which are important if the economy is to get back on track.</br></br>When a company boosts productivity, it can squeeze more output from its existing workers without drastically increasing costs. At the same time, it helps keep a lid on inflation, as companies grow without incurring new expenses that they would otherwise pass on to customers."
"The 1.3 percent raise that federal and military retirees will get in January will be the lowest cost-of-living adjustment they've received since 1986, when they also got a 1.3 percent COLA. The increase is official and will first show up in checks received in January.</br></br>People getting Social Security benefits -- and that includes many federal retirees, too -- will also get the 1.3 percent raise. It reflects the rise in living costs, as measured by the consumer price index between the third quarter of this year (July, August and September) and the third quarter of 1997. In other words, inflation for that 12-month period rose only 1.3 percent.</br></br>While many retirees are disappointed with a COLA of only 1.3 percent, most experts say it is a good thing because it means inflation is low and prices are stable. Retirees longing for the good old days of double-digit COLAs forget what double-digit inflation can do to prices on everything from food to cars. In 1979, retirees got a 10.8 percent COLA. In 1980, the COLA was 13.7 percent. And in 1981 (the last time retirees got two raises in one year), they got 13.1 percent. That was a period of double-digit inflation. It also was before Congress voted to eliminate the twice-a-year COLAs that some feared would eventually push the cost of civil service retirement higher than payroll costs.</br></br>Since that time, federal retirees have had to fight regularly (and usually with success) to get one full COLA a year. There was no COLA adjustment in 1985, and Congress and the White House delayed COLAs for three months (paying them in April instead of January) in 1994, 1995 and 1996.</br></br>Workers who retire under the old Civil Service Retirement System get a full COLA each year. Workers who retire under the newer Federal Employees Retirement System are under a ""diet COLA"" system. They get a full COLA on the CSRS portion of their annuity. But the FERS portion of their annuity is subject to different rules. For example, if living costs (as measured by the CPI) are up 2 percent or less, both groups get the same increase. But if the rise in living costs is between 2 and 3 percent, CSRS benefits go up by the full amount, while payments on the FERS portion rise by only 2 percent. If the CPI goes up 3 percent or more, FERS benefits equal the CPI minus 1 percent."

"The Reagan administration, in its first major statement on monetary policy, yesterday urged the Federal Reserve Board to stop paying attention to the level of interest rates and begin concentrating on one rather than several measures of the money supply. Treasury Undersecretary Beryl Sprinkle advised the Fed to allow its discount rate to vary more freely with market rates.</br></br>Sprinkel gave detailed technical advice to Fed Chairman Paul Volcker on how to achieve the steadier, slower money growth which both Reagan officials and the Fed support. The Fed‰Ûªs offical response yesterday was ‰ÛÏno comment.‰Û</br></br>Sprinkel emphasised in testimony before the Joint Economic Committee that the Fed was an independent agency, and that the administration did not want to change that. Over the last few months the Fed has done a good job of conducting monetary policy he said. But he made no bones about his view that monetary policy at times in the past has been too erratic and too centered on controlling interest rates.</br></br>He said that he had spoken to Volcker about his suggestions, but he refused to tell the committee of the chairman‰Ûªs response. The Undersecretary‰Ûªs testimony had been cleared with the Council of Economic advisers, the Office of Management and Budget, and Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan, Sprinkel said.</br></br>Although the administration does not expect significant progress towards lowering inflation this year, Sprinkel told the JEC, there could be a drop to single-digit inflation by the end of this year."
"The nation's unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent last month, as stronger-than-expected hiring by builders, retailers, restaurants and other service providers more than offset layoffs by manufacturers, the government reported yesterday.</br></br>The gain of 267,000 payroll jobs in November, which was much greater than many analysts had anticipated, showed that the nation's labor markets remained strong despite the recent flurry of corporate layoff announcements.</br></br>Boeing Co., Johnson & Johnson, Merrill Lynch & Co. and merging oil companies Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. are among the corporate giants that have recently announced plans to slash tens of thousands of jobs. But many of those cuts won't occur for months or years. Meanwhile, other payrolls are booming.</br></br>""The U.S. growth story remains a tale of two economies, with the manufacturing sector shedding 47,000 jobs in November, purchasing agents reporting the weakest factory conditions since February 1996 and {new factory} orders dropping in October,"" said Bill Dudley, chief economist at Goldman Sachs & Co. in New York.</br></br>More than compensating for those job losses were a jump of 55,000 jobs at firms providing business services, including temporary help, and of 47,000 in construction. Unusually strong holiday hiring boosted retail trade employment by 65,000 jobs, the Labor Department said."
"Mike Synar, 45, the brash, bright and buoyant Oklahoman who represented the people of his state's 2nd District in the U.S. House of Representatives for eight terms before losing the Democratic primary for renomination in 1994, died of brain cancer Jan. 9 at his home in Washington. The cancer had been diagnosed in July 1995.</br></br>Mr. Synar, a lawyer, rancher and real estate broker from a prominent ranching family in conservative northeast Oklahoma, was first elected to the House in 1978.</br></br>During his years in Congress, he vigorously supported campaign finance reform, stricter gun control and environmental legislation. He also voted for higher grazing fees for cattle on public lands, and he seemed to find himself in opposition to the tobacco industry, ranchers and the gun lobbies.</br></br>In the 99th Congress, Mr. Synar led the House opposition to the Gramm-Rudman plan to reduce the budget deficit, a measure favored by conservatives and thought to be immensely popular in a district such as his. After losing the fight in Congress, Mr. Synar helped start legal challenges to the plan, which helped lead to a portion of the law being declared unconstitutional.</br></br>His stands were thought to be anathema to his conservative constituents, but they continued to back Mr. Synar until 1994. That year, he was upset in a primary runoff by a retired teacher, who went on to lose to Republican Tom Coburn, an obstetrician, in the general election."
"Wall Street analysts today shrugged off Clinton administration predictions that financial markets will swoon if the president's budget is defeated. They said the package was too riddled with taxes and compromises for investors to care much if it lives or dies.</br></br>A defeat of the measure would be unexpected, Wall Street executives said, and would send the bond market down and might sour stocks temporarily. But they said the impact would be relatively mild and probably lead to expectations of a better budget bill later in the summer.</br></br>""There would be some effect, but I'm not sure that it would be major or lasting,"" said Marshall Acuff, the portfolio strategist at Smith Barney Shearson.</br></br>Some Washington officials have warned that if Congress backs away from the plan, which is supposed to cut the federal deficit by $500 billion over five years, the financial markets will be shaken. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, for example, said Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was ""right on target"" in predicting a negative market reaction in such a case.</br></br>""I think you'd see an immediate up-spike in interest rates and with that you normally correlate a drop in the stock market,"" Bentsen said."

"The current sharp slide in the stock market has elicited a variety of explanations. We are told that investors fear a possible Gore presidency and a Democratic Congress. That Federal Reserve monetary policy has been too tight, jeopardizing the prospects for a ""soft landing."" Or that a speculative ""bubble"" in technology stocks has finally burst. In each case it is assumed that something has changed drastically; somehow, for some very important reason, investors now look at the market very differently than they did a few months ago.</br></br>I believe this view reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how stocks are valued. To get back to the basics, over the long run stocks are worth exactly (and only) an amount equal to the discounted future value of the cash flows investors expect to receive from them. This is usually taken to mean both future dividends and share repurchases that put money back into the hands of stockholders.</br></br>What most analysts fail to understand when they breathlessly seek out dramatic reasons for major moves in the market is that in this model relatively minor changes in assumptions about interest rates, and the rate of future dividend increases, can create very large shifts in theoretical stock valuations.</br></br>Take, for example, the 1987 crash. Immediately before the crash, dividends were roughly 3%, and interest rates 10%. (For purposes of simplicity, we shall ignore share repurchases.) This means that, given the assumptions of the model, investors before the crash were anticipating that future dividends would grow at a 7% annual rate.</br></br>What if investors became slightly more conservative? For example, as economist Merton Miller has pointed out, if investors in the fall of 1987 increased their forecast for interest rates by only 0.5%, and also reduced the rate at which they expected dividends to grow by a similar 0.5%, a whopping 25% drop in stock prices would have resulted. (In fact, the market fell by 22% on Oct. 19, 1987.)"

"Japan shares fell into correction territory Friday, pressured by global market volatility, but stocks in Indonesia jumped ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Joko Widodo.</br></br>Japan's Nikkei Stock Average, Asia's biggest victim of fears about a global slowdown given the country's heavy reliance on global trade, fell 1.4% to 14,532.51. The index is now down more than 10% from its recent peak at the end of September--a move described by analysts as a correction.</br></br>The last time the Nikkei had such a fall was May last year, when worries about the U.S. Federal Reserve tapering its economic stimulus program roiled markets globally.</br></br>Financial markets have been struck by volatility over the past week and a half, amid concerns about a stagnating European economy, questions about the strength of the U.S. economy and again, worries about the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates.</br></br>There are signs that the selloff in Asia is cooling, however."
"Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker yesterday said that, the value of the U.S. dollar has declined far enough in the past 18 months to make American industry competitive again in world markets.</br></br>However, Volcker cautioned id testimony before the House Ways and Means trade subcommittee that other economic policy actions must be taken both here and abroad before the swollen U.S. trade deficit can be reduced to acceptable levels.</br></br>Those steps include reducihg consumption in the United States in favor of more investment, beginning with cuts in the federal government‰Ûªs budget deficit, he said. ‰Û÷Tor other countries, some appropriate mix of monetary, fiscal and other policies to sustain and enhance domestic demand are required if their trade surpluses are to decline in a context of healthy world growth,‰Û he continued.</br></br>Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III and Volcker have been pressing the Japanese and West German governments to stimulate domestic demand in their countries, and both have been resisting. Last week, Baker said that the alternative would have to be still further depreciation of the dollar, and his remarks temporarily knocked the currency down on foreign exchange markets.</br></br>Volcker, as he has frequently-in the past, warned that ""without support of other policies, exchange rate changes can be counterproductive in important respects‰ÛÓinflationary in the United States, and a restraint on demand and economic activity abroad.‰Û"
"Evidence is growing that the Federal Reserve is allowing a key short-term interest rate to rise slightly further in its effort to restrain inflationary pressures.</br></br>Economists also say several foreign central banks may be tightening credit soon.

But an increase in the federal funds rate recently is said to suggest the Fed is willing to err slightly on the side of a tighter policy.</br></br>Federal Reserve actions in the money markets yesterday and late last week apparently convinced some analysts that the central bank is trying to push the federal funds rate up to about 7 1/2%.

"WASHINGTON -- Moving to bolster confidence even before the stock market opened, the Federal Reserve cut its target for short-term interest rates by one-half percentage point and promised to continue to supply ""unusually large volumes of liquidity to the financial markets, as needed, until more normal market functioning is restored.""</br></br>The Fed's move was followed by the European Central Bank as well as the Canadian and Swiss central banks, but not by the Bank of England. ""Following the terrorist attacks on the U.S.,"" the ECB said, using blunter language than the Fed, ""uncertainty about the U.S. and the world economy has increased.""</br></br>The Fed left the door open to further rate cuts, emphasizing the weakness that had been seen in employment, production and business spending even before last Tuesday's terror, and the economic risks ahead.</br></br>The size and timing of the central bank's next move depends on the course taken by the economy and financial markets in the coming weeks.</br></br>""Any projections about what the economy and the Fed will do in coming months need to be taken as even more tentative than usual,"" economists at UBS Warburg said, even as they predicted a one-quarter-point interest-rate cut at the Fed's Oct. 2 meeting and another of the same size in November."

You have to go back to 1972 when the Nixon price controls were in effect‰ÛÓor even back to 1967 depending on what measure you choose‰ÛÓto find a year in which prices behaved better.</br></br>The nation, however, paid a very high price in lost jobs and output to get that improvement. Unemployment is still far above the 3.8 rate experienced in 1967. And a lot of things not controllable by economic policy-makers‰ÛÓnotably energy prices ^‰ÛÓhappened to break the right way last year. Will inflation stay in line as the recovery proceeds?</br></br>Many of the most important inflation-feeders were quiescent in 1983. Energy prices, for example, actually declined somewhat following a small rise the year before. Food prices fell in the early months, although summer drought caused a 2.6 percent net rise over the whole year. The high value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets kept imports cheap. Interest rates were more or less stable, big tax breaks lowered costs for many producers and cautious inventory buildup policies kept suppliers from boosting their prices as the recovery took hold. Wage give-backs were still in fashion, and average hourly wage gains were modest.</br></br>Since labor productivity‰ÛÓoutput per worker‰ÛÓrose smartly, at least in the first three-quarters of the year, unit labor costs rose only 1.4 percent."
"INVESTORS' PRE-THANKSGIVING cheer propelled the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its fifth straight day of gains Wednesday, leading some traders to worry about a postholiday hangover.</br></br>The Dow temporarily soared as high as 10950 before finishing at 10916.09, up 44.66 points, or 0.41%, and just about 24 points short of a 41/2-year high. The Nasdaq Composite Index and the S&P 500, meanwhile, both reached 41/2-year highs.</br></br>But the rally has left some investors fretting about a reversal. In one ominous sign noted by technically minded traders, the Relative Strength Index has risen to a level not seen in a year. That index measures the relationship of up to down days in the S&P 500, and when it starts climbing it's often read as a sign that the stock market is overheated.</br></br>""You can't go up every single day,"" said Todd Leone, head of listed trading at brokerage firm SG Cowen. ""At some point the market's got to rest.""</br></br>Stock and bond markets were closed yesterday for the Thanksgiving holiday, and both markets close early today. Stocks' advances Wednesday came amid sliding oil prices and investors' hopes that the Federal Reserve might stop raising interest rates soon."
"WASHINGTON -- Although the unemployment rate dropped sharply in May, employment statistics for the month indicate the economy was growing much more slowly than in April.</br></br>Civilian unemployment fell to 7.5% of the work force in May after sticking at 7.8% in March and April, the Labor Department said. A separate measure, which includes members of the military among the employed, dropped to 7.4% in May from 7.7%.</br></br>The drop returned the jobless rate to its level of November 1980, when Ronald Reagan was elected president. Any further declines in the coming months will enable the president to claim during his reelection campaign that his administration brought down both inflation and unemployment.</br></br>But the decline of the unemployment rate is more a reflection of the economy's previous strength than of its strength in May. While employment rose sharply during the month, the number of hours worked by the average employee declined from the unusually high level of April, and average earnings also declined. That suggests industrial production and personal income rose modestly in May, if at all.</br></br>""We just exchanged bodies for hours,"" said Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University. ""May was a standstill month. In real GNP (gross national product), we are talking no change."""
"After seesawing through the summer between gut-wrenching triple-digit selloffs and euphoric triple-digit rallies, the stock market last week appeared to have finally made up its mind.</br></br>And it wasn't pretty.</br></br>Yet another wave of concern over European debt and fresh fears that the U.S. is sliding back into recession whacked investments across the board, from emerging markets to gold futures, small caps to blue chips.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 big stocks tumbled 6.4%, the Dow's worst week since Oct. 10, 2008. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished down 6.5%, while the tech-dominiated Nasdaq Composite dropped 5.3%. Asian and European indexes logged similar declines.</br></br>Oil prices fell 9.2%. Silver fell 26%. And even gold, the market darling of the past year, dropped 9.6%."
"The latest economic news dashes hopes that a short and shallow recession can cure inflation. For the country is already in a recession, and inflation continues to mount. So the immediate - question is how to devise a tax cut that . will arrest recession in ways that do not aggravate inflation even further. A larger and more interesting question is ‰ÐÊwhether the tax cut can be made the occasion for developing a comprehensive new economic strategy.</br></br>Tae evidence of recession comes with a new set of employment numbers. In August, the jobless rate rose from 5.7 percent to 6 percent. Total employment ‰ÐÊwent down by over 300,000 jobs.</br></br>Behind those figures is a long cycle of connected events. First there was a drop in final sales. Next a rise in inventories. Then orders were cut back. In response, manufacturers reduced production. Only then did businesses begin laying off workers.</br></br>The drop in total jobs, in other words, is a lagging indicator. It tells enough of what has been happening in the second and third quarters to announce that the economy is very ,weak. Even Lyle Gram-ley, the super-cautious numbers man on the president‰Ûªs Council of Economic Advisers, says, ‰ÛÏI wouldn‰Ûªt quibble about using the term recession now.‰Û</br></br>The onset of recession has not, however, curbed inflation. Thanks in large part to pinches in the supply of crude oil, food and housing, the Consumer Price Index is rising this year at an annual rate of over 13 percent. The underlying inflation rate‰ÛÓa term that fences out erratic supply pinches and measures the price rises manufacturers need to keep profits constant‰ÛÓis about 9 percent."
"The U.S. economy continued its recent record of surprisingly strong growth last quarter, with the Commerce Department reporting a 3.9 percent gain in the July-September period, half a point faster than previously thought.</br></br>The upward revision in the growth rate was due mostly to evidence that business investment in new equipment was greater than had been indicated by the initial figures released in October. The revised numbers were based on more complete source data, some of which is estimated in the advance release.</br></br>This latest evidence that the economy is surging ahead pushed up short-term interest rates yesterday. Investors and traders said they expect the Federal Reserve might seek to cool off the economy by providing less cash to the banking system, a move that would boost key overnight interest rates again. The Fed raised its target for overnight rates earlier this month by three-fourths of a percentage point, the sixth increase this year.</br></br>However, some analysts said the Fed likely would leave rates unchanged for the next two months as its policy makers wait to see whether this year's rate increases begin to slow economic growth. The central bank favors slower growth in the hope it will curb inflation.</br></br>The bond market, often prone to inflation worries, took yesterday's Commerce Department report in stride, partly because of another revision, also announced yesterday, that indicated that the economy has extra capacity to grow."
"WASHINGTON -- The U.S. trade deficit swelled to $11.31 billion in June, surprising some analysts, as export growth eased off. But Clinton administration officials stressed that the long-term prospects for U.S. sales abroad remained strong.</br></br>The Commerce Department reported that the trade deficit widened from a revised $11.05 billion in May. Private analysts had expected the June deficit to be somewhat narrower than May's, based on earlier economic reports. Imports in June slowed to a seasonally adjusted $75.79 billion from $76.29 billion in May, but exports also fell, to $64.48 billion from $65.24 billion.</br></br>""This caught us a little bit by surprise. It was a little bit worse than expected,"" said Brian Horrigan, senior economist at Loomis Sayles & Co. in Boston. He added that the trade deficit would have been wider, had it not been for a decline in crude-oil prices in June.</br></br>For the first half, the trade deficit in goods and services mushroomed to $63.80 billion from $49.94 billion in the year-earlier period.</br></br>Administration officials put the best gloss on the figures, insisting that the important development was the surge in export growth in the first half. Some private analysts agreed, noting that the export trend is at record levels and that continued strength of U.S. imports reflects the strength of the U.S. economy."
"The Senate passed, 69 to 2:i, Thursday a new budget resolution calling for a $74.8 billion federal deficit in the present fiscal year, $(> billion higher than Congress voted for in May, and a binding spending ceiling of $375.6 billion.</br></br>These figures compare with $367 billion in spending and a $68.8 billion deficit fixed in the May resolution.</br></br>The increases are almost wholly accounted for by so-called uncontrollables such as higher interest payments on the public debt, and boosts in unemployment compensation, veterans benefits and oilier entitlement programs.</br></br>The House, which passed its revised budget resolution earlier this month, provided for a $1.7 billion lower spending ceiling and a $2.7 billion smaller deficit than llie Senate.</br></br>The Senate resolution projects a $300.8 billion revenue floor for 1976. This would allow lor about $6.4 billion in addit ional tax cuts so that tax withholding rates in calendar 1976 can be held at 1975 levels."
"The president's budget this week boasts of the Clinton commitment to biomedical research by generously funding the National Institutes of Health budget.</br></br>It ""renews the commitment"" that the president made to vastly expanding biomedical research. This funding, the administration notes, has ""made the United States the world leader in medical research.""</br></br>If you buy that rhetoric then you can accept the president's definition of ""is"" -- as in there ""is no sexual affair"" -- or ""alone"" -- as in whether he was ""alone"" while having oral sex.</br></br>The truth is the president has beaten an unconscionable retreat in his NIH budget. Last year, prodded by outside groups like Research America, a bipartisan group of legislators committed themselves to doubling the health-research budget over the next five years. The first installment was a 15% hike to $15.6 billion for the current fiscal year. In signing that legislation, the president praised it as a ""critical downpayment"" for his 21st-century research fund for America, and while he proposed a 50% hike over five years, he indicated support for doubling that budget.</br></br>In the 2000 budget, however, he seeks only a 2% increase, not even enough to keep pace with inflation; this would be the smallest increase in the NIH budget this decade. Health-research experts say this budget would stifle the NIH's momentum, lessen the prospects for major breakthroughs in the next decade, leave scores of promising grant proposals unfulfilled and discourage bright young scientists from entering the biomedical research field."

"What a difference a month makes.</br></br>In July, consumer confidence reached a 29-year high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at an all-time high, unemployment rates plumbed 28-year lows, and the dollar grew stronger against virtually every currency on earth. By late August consumer confidence was down, as was the dollar, and a growing number of economists were forecasting recession in 1999. Yet no sooner had the doomsayers spoken then the Dow rebounded and the economic outlook brightened once again.</br></br>Volatile markets will always be with us. But what's of real concern is the increasingly volatile and self-contradictory nature of our economic policies. The Federal Reserve, shifting abruptly from the inflation front to the recession front, has cut short-term interest rates by half a percentage point and revved up monetary growth rates beyond nearly all targeted growth ranges. Yet undermining this new tack are constrictive fiscal policies -- higher taxes and burgeoning regulations -- which virtually guarantee that output cannot keep pace with the money supply. If previous business cycles are any guide, the result will almost certainly be a return of inflation and the end of the steady-growth economy.</br></br>Fiscal and regulatory policies today are particularly burdensome. Taxes consume 42% of personal income, and regulations cost 10% of gross domestic product. The federal tax code has grown from 11,400 words when it was conceived in 1913 to 555 million words today. Last year's Taxpayer Relief Act, which like so many of its predecessors was billed as a tax-code simplifier, actually created 824 amendments and added 285 new sections to the existing code. It requires an estimated 60 million hours of extra work by taxpayers, creates 18 new tax forms and revises 230 existing forms. As Mark Twain said, ""History may not repeat itself, but it sure rhymes.""</br></br>What measures might be taken to synchronize fiscal and monetary policies into a pro-growth, price-stabilizing mode? Years ago, Milton Friedman recommended putting the Fed on automatic pilot, meaning that it should create money at a steady rate of 3% to 5%, consistent with the estimated long-term growth potential of real output. In revisiting this guide, it is especially helpful to recall that in its 84-year history the Fed has tended to be reactive rather than pre-emptive. Its sudden midcourse corrections have merely amplified the swings of the business cycle."

"After lying low for a couple of decades, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is back with a vengeance. The cartel has rediscovered its economic muscle and driven up oil prices to more than $30 a barrel. Democrats and Republicans alike are demanding that government bring down prices. But before we dust off the policy playbook of the Carter era, we should recall some lessons learned.</br></br>First, begging OPEC heads of state to increase production -- as Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is now doing -- is a waste of time. Production decisions are determined by financial considerations. Nothing will change that. Trying to convince OPEC that it's in the cartel's best interest to head off a global recession -- thus, that it should increase oil production -- is naive. OPEC members are almost entirely dependent on the oil trade. So long as oil profits remain robust, global recession need not concern them. The recessions of 1974 and 1979 demonstrated that OPEC can make a lot of money during hard times.</br></br>Second, investigating ""big oil"" for price gouging is counterproductive. In the 1970s those suspicions were stoked by stories of oil tankers lingering offshore, supposedly waiting for prices to go up before they unloaded their cargo. Tankers were indeed lingering, but it was because docks were overloaded and ships had to wait to unload. Big oil -- then and now -- is guilty only of passing on its increased costs to consumers instead of selling at a loss.</br></br>Political saber rattling about alleged corporate profiteering makes the crisis worse. The only hedge against supply disruptions in the near term is inventories. But inventories are costly to maintain. If companies can't cash them out at a profit during price spikes because they fear criminal investigation or the imposition of windfall-profit taxes, they won't bother maintaining inventories.</br></br>Ironically, that is the upshot of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Politicians, alarmed that oil companies don't keep stockpiles, decided that the government must do so. Yet the existence of the reserve makes it certain that companies won't stockpile. Oil companies don't know if or when government might flood the market, dropping prices and preventing them from profiting from their inventories."
"WASHINGTON--Construction of new homes fell sharply in June, highlighting risks to the sector's recovery from rising mortgage rates and supply constraints.</br></br>Housing starts declined 9.9% in June from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 836,000 units, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Building permits, a key measure of future construction activity, fell by 7.5%. The readings were much worse than expected, with most economists forecasting modest gains in both categories.</br></br>But the decline in housing starts was primarily driven by a 26% drop in multifamily housing, a category that has traditionally been volatile and has lately shown signs of overbuilding. Starts for single-family homes, which account for the largest share of activity, fell by 0.8%. Single-family permits rose 0.1%.</br></br>""The outlook for housing is still bright,"" said Moody's Analytics economist Celia Chen.

"NEW YORK -- As technology stocks showed signs of recovery, with the Nasdaq Composite Index climbing back toward the 4000 level, bets on a pullback have increased.</br></br>The level of short sales not yet closed out, known as short interest, on the Nasdaq Stock Market rose 1% to 2,808,345,712 shares on June 15 from 2,780,161,105 shares in mid-May, according to Nasdaq. The figures include Nasdaq small-capitalization and large-capitalization stocks.</br></br>On the Nasdaq Small-Cap Market, which is made up of the 893 smaller-cap stocks, the number of short sales outstanding fell 16.9%. It rose 1.5% for the 3,842 larger-cap stocks on the Nasdaq National Market. The figures suggest that investors are betting large-cap stocks have a greater chance of declining than small-caps.</br></br>Short interest is often considered an indication of the level of skepticism in the market. Traders who sell securities ""short"" borrow shares and then sell them, betting they can profit by buying the stock back later at lower prices.</br></br>Short interest reflects the number of shares that haven't been repurchased for return to lenders.

"The government's ability to understand and predict hurricanes, drought and climate changes of all kinds is in danger because of deep cuts facing many Earth satellite programs and major delays in launching some of its most important new instruments, a panel of experts has concluded.</br></br>The two-year study by the National Academy of Sciences, released yesterday, determined that NASA's earth science budget has declined 30 percent since 2000. It stands to fall further as funding shifts to plans for a manned mission to the moon and Mars. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, meanwhile, has experienced enormous cost overruns and schedule delays with its premier weather and climate mission.</br></br>As a result, the panel said, the United States will not have the scientific information it needs in the years ahead to analyze severe storms and changes in Earth's climate unless programs are restored and funding made available.</br></br>""NASA's budget has taken a major hit at the same time that NOAA's program has fallen off the rails,"" said panel co-chairman Berrien Moore III of the University of New Hampshire. ""This combination is very, very disturbing, and it's coming at the very time that we need the information most.""</br></br>NOAA officials announced last week that 2006 was the warmest year on record in the United States -- part of a highly unusual warming trend over several decades that many scientists attribute to greenhouse gases.

"The recession knocked Procter & Gamble's stock out cold. Have the smelling salts finally arrived?</br></br>Shares of the world's largest consumer-products company have gained just 2% since the start of 2009, compared with a 22% rise for rival Colgate-Palmolive. The latter relies less on high-end products that consumers have forgone and has a stronger emerging-markets position. Since long before the economic crisis unfolded, Colgate's shares have traded at a premium price/earnings multiple.</br></br>Procter should have a healthier glow when both companies report quarterly earnings Thursday. Price reductions appear to have helped Procter win back market share in recent months, which should have underpinned strong sales. But those price cuts have been limited to about 10% of the company's portfolio and could damage Procter's margins and brands if extended much further.</br></br>The bigger question for Procter is whether consumers in the U.S. and Western Europe are ready to trade back up to its premium products. A survey of both high and low-income groups shows consumers have become willing to spend more on consumer products in the last two months, according to Bill Pecoriello of Consumer Edge Research. That could drive an impressive sales recovery, but only if developed economies stay on course and labor markets improve steadily.</br></br>Colgate's prospects look more dependable. Unlike Procter, which is saddled with low-growth products such as diapers and toilet paper, Colgate has a smaller portfolio generating faster sales increases."
"NEW YORK -- Bullish bond market sentiment is on the rise again.</br></br>As the government prepares to release the next batch of economic reports, the consensus among economists and money managers is that the news will be negative. And that, they say, will be good for bonds.</br></br>""Recent data have indicated somewhat weaker economic activity,"" said Elliott Platt, director of economic research at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities. Mr. Platt is advising clients that ""the near-term direction of bond prices is likely to remain upward.""</br></br>Analysts insist that even without help from a shaky stock market, which provided a temporary boost for bonds during the Oct. 13 stock market plunge, bond prices will start to climb on the prospects that the Federal Reserve will allow interest rates to move lower in the coming weeks.</br></br>That would be comforting to fixed-income investors, many of whom were badly burned in the third quarter by incorrectly assuming that the Fed would ease. Investors rushed to buy bonds during the summer as prices soared on speculation that interest rates would continue to fall. But when it became clear that rates had stabilized and that the Fed's credit-easing policy was on hold, bond yields jumped and prices tumbled."
"Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's worries about inflation and recession sent the stock market on a roller-coaster ride, as broad market indexes touched all-time highs before ending lower in heavy trading.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average shot up more than 28 points to 2612.67 and broader averages hit record levels after Mr. Greenspan indicated in his morning testimony that he wanted to keep the economy out of a recession. But when he reaffirmed in his afternoon testimony that the Fed is committed to fighting inflation, prices plunged. The industrial average ended the day off 8.92 at 2575.49.</br></br>The bond market, in contrast, showed little enthusiasm for the chairman's early remarks. Prices rose, but not as sharply as stock prices. As the day wore on and traders evaluated Mr. Greenspan's remarks, prices slipped, and long-term Treasury issues ended about unchanged. The dollar ended lower against other major currencies.</br></br>Analysts said Mr. Greenspan's morning testimony squared almost perfectly with investors' perceptions that the economy is headed for a ""soft landing"" -- slower economic growth, declining inflation and interest rates, but no recession. Stock investors and traders interpreted the comments as a switch in the Fed's focus from fighting inflation to keeping the economy out of recession. The idea that the Fed would allow short-term interest rates to fall sharply to keep the economy out of recession buoyed investors' outlook.</br></br>But in his afternoon comments, Mr. Greenspan made it clear that the Fed isn't abandoning the inflation fight. He reaffirmed that zero inflation remains the Fed's long-term goal and that current levels of inflation are worrisome. While he said interest rates will fall further, he also said the short-term goal is to bring money-supply growth up to the lower end of its target band. In recent months, money growth has been below target levels."
"President Reagan‰Ûªs economic policies are unfair. Interest rates are out of control. Unemployment is far too high.</br></br>President Reagan is a strong leader. He is effective in dealing with Congress. He represented the United States well on his recent European trip. He is liked by three of every four Americans.</br></br>That is a summary of what White House pollster Richard Wirthlin‰Ûªs surveys are reporting at the 18-month point of the Reagan presidency. The Wirthlin polls also suggest that Reagan has defused the nuclear freeze issue by his arms control initiatives and has generally improved his standing on foreign policy, even as it is slumping on economic performance.</br></br>But the public perception of the Reagan foreign policy, like the policy itself, is clouded by events in the Middle East. Two of three Americans think the U.S. response to the Israelis after the invasion of Lebanon was too weak even though the Palestine Liberation Organization has the lowest standing of any institution or individual</br></br>Overall, the dualism of Reagan‰Ûªs standing with the electorate can be expressed in a single sentence: Three of 10 Americans who disagree with Reagan policies remain supportive of the president. In Wirthlin‰Ûªs polls, as in some published surveys, Reagan‰Ûªs standing has now inched upward to slightly above 50 percent after plummeting early in the year."
"NEW YORK, Jan. 2 (AP)‰ÛÓTlie Stock Market‰Ûªs 1962 debut was far from glamorous. Although nine more stocks advanced than declined today, the averages were dragged down to sharp losses by steep declines in blue chips.

American Telephone, which had a net gain of 29 points last year, fell 2 Vi.

"Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>Foreign investors increased purchases of U.S. securities in June for the first time in five months, evidence foreign demand is ample to sufficiently finance the U.S. current-account deficit.</br></br>Foreigners bought $71.8 billion in U.S. stocks and bonds in June, up from $65.2 billion in May, according to the Treasury Department. Analysts estimate $45 billion to $50 billion in foreign investment is needed each month to finance the U.S. current-account gap, the broadest gauge of the nation's global trade. It stood at a record $144.9 billion in the first quarter.</br></br>So far this year, foreign net purchases of U.S. securities are averaging around $75 billion a month, up from about $50 billion a month last year, analysts say. ""Worries about the ability of the U.S. to finance its twin deficits -- the current-account deficit and budget deficit -- remain overblown,"" said Tony Crescenzi, chief bond-market strategist at Miller Tabak.</br></br>The June foreign-investment data exceeded financial markets' expectations that net purchases would be between $50 billion and $60 billion.

"The U.S. government debt is rising inexorably, according to the conventional wisdom in Washington, and the political system is too paralyzed to take unpopular actions to rein it in. Privately, many policymakers take it as a given that the situation will change only when the nation faces a Greek-style fiscal crisis.</br></br>But apparently nobody told the people who lend the U.S. government money. On Friday, they were willing to hand over their cash to the Treasury for 10 years for 3.3 percent interest, a level so low it implies they consider the United States among the safest investments in the world. Collectively, those investors -- think mutual funds, pension funds and foreign central banks -- could lose hundreds of billions of dollars if they're mistaken and the United States has a debt crisis.</br></br>Perceptions inside the Beltway rest on this idea: Although the current large budget deficit is caused mainly by the weak economy and a short-term economic stimulus that will soon expire, in the longer run the government faces a vast unfunded burden, particularly tied to Medicare and Medicaid.</br></br>The mix of spending cuts and tax increases that could close the gap are wildly unpopular. With the threat of a filibuster in the Senate hanging over anything remotely controversial, a bipartisan budget accord seems unlikely. And many Republicans have declared they will not vote for a package that includes a tax increase under any circumstance.</br></br>This situation led Moody's, the debt-rating firm, to state in March that the U.S. government is nearer to being at risk of losing its Aaa credit rating and that maintaining the rating might require adjustments to tax and spending policy ""of a magnitude that, in some cases, will test social cohesion."""

He didn't live long enough to experience Ben Bernanke.</br></br>Last week the Federal Reserve chairman told the world that U.S. savers should expect the new normal of near-zero interest rates to last through mid-2015. So compound interest is a concept with which today's early to mid 20-somethings will remain essentially unfamiliar.</br></br>For those of us who are slightly older, it seems as if Mr. Bernanke is on a mission to convince us that everything our grandparents told us about household economics was wrong.</br></br>My grandmother and grandfather were children of the Depression who built a successful dry-cleaning business with inspiration from--no kidding--a Wall Street Journal article.

It was the third consecutive decline.</br></br>""The number is down just a little bit, but we're still on pace for a very strong year,"" said Fred Flick, vice president of economic research for the NAR.</br></br>Economists attribute the decline to the Federal Reserve's recent interest-rate increases and argue that it may help show policy makers that the economy can cool enough without a further rate increase when officials meet on Nov. 16.</br></br>The Fed has already raised rates twice this year-in June and in Augustand economists are trying to figure out whether those moves are working by slowing growth down and, if so, by how much.

He cited Commerce Department figures indicating that 5.5 million workers will receive wage increases averaging 73A per cent in 1971 under already-negotiated contracts; that contrasts, lie said, with an average 5% per cent increase for the same number of workers who received automatic wage increases last year.</br></br>Moreover, according to Kendall, another 5 million workers will negotiate new wage agreements this year. Affected industries include steel, alum-ninum, aerospace, auto parts, and utilities, he said, suggesting that contract talks might simply be postponed for a year.</br></br>Although Kendall indicated he preferred to see wage-price restraint originate voluntarily from labor and management, John D. Stewart, president of the Bureau of National Affairs, told the meeting that the Administration will ultimately be forced to embrace sterner measures to combat wage and price increases."
"While much of the country spent the first three months of 2014 sheltering against snow and ice, banks began to fire up the lending furnaces.</br></br>That is welcome news for bank investors. Loan growth has been the missing ingredient for banks for some time. Without it, they have been left to try to bolster earnings through repeated rounds of cost cutting and reversals of loan-loss reserves, even as the Federal Reserve's superlow interest rate policy has weighed heavily on margins.</br></br>While loan growth seen in the first quarter isn't yet strong enough to suggest banks are anywhere near out of the woods, it does provide some reason to hope the lending environment is improving. And it could bode well for banks' coming first-quarter results, especially as firms continue to grapple with lower mortgage-origination activity.</br></br>Not that any lending gains have been immediately apparent. In the first quarter through the third week of March, the latest date for which Federal Reserve data are available, overall bank loans grew from a year earlier at an average of 2.5%.</br></br>The pace is the same as seen in the final quarter of 2013. While this at least marked stabilization following a long period of declining rates of loan growth, it wasn't anything for bank investors to write home about."
"Your Sept. 17 article ""SEC Sweep of 45 Day-Trading Firms"" highlights the unhealthy and irresponsible speculation taking place in the stock market. In light of the day-trading information already possessed by securities industry regulators, it is time this activity was closely regulated. Unless day trading is checked, this widespread speculative fever may well lead to social, economic and financial disasters.</br></br>The Federal Reserve should prohibit the extension of margin loans to day traders and limit commercial banks' lending to day-trading brokerage firms. Special higher capital requirements on day-trading brokerage firms should be imposed by the SEC and the NASD. Regulators should mandate that the funds devoted to day trading by any day trader should be restricted by that individual's overall net financial resources. Finally, regulators ought to limit the number of trades by an individual day trader and his brokerage firm on any given day. Moreover, legislation should be passed making it a criminal offense to post information on the Web that is unsubstantiated and unverified.</br></br>It is irresponsible for regulators not to have begun imposing restrictions on day-trading individuals and firms. They are the new ""boiler shops"" of this seven-to-eight-year bull market.</br></br>E. Magnus Oppenheim</br></br>President"

"LOS ANGELES -- The once-astounding growth of First Executive Corp. has slowed to a crawl, mostly because of tougher regulation by state insurance commissioners.</br></br>In its annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the aggressive life insurance holding company provided its most detailed explanation for last year's drop in premium revenue and indicated its responses to regulatory changes will slow future growth.

Much of First Executive's success in the past stemmed from the higher rates it offered to pay policyholders, fueled by its investments in junk bonds."
"WASHINGTON -- The operating rate at the nation's factories, mines and utilities was unchanged at 82.4% of capacity last month, the highest pace since March 1980, the Federal Reserve Board said.</br></br>The relatively high level provides another sign of the revival of the nation's manufacturing sector over the past year, partly in reponse to strong export demand. The rates for December and January were raised from 82.2%. In March 1980, the rate stood at 83.7%.</br></br>Continued increases in the operating rate are leading to fears of production bottlenecks and inflationary shortages in some industries, such as chemicals and steel, although excess capacity overseas will help curb such pressures. In addition, the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.7% of the work force, approaching a level that some economists contend will touch off inflationary pressures.</br></br>Factories operated at 82.5% last month, unchanged from January. Producers of durable goods used 80.1% of capacity in February, the same as in January, while producers of nondurable goods used 85.9%, down from 86.1%. The motor vehicles and parts industry used 77%, down from 77.4%.</br></br>The rate fell to 80.6% from 81.1% for the mining industry and rose to 82.2% from 81.7% for utilities.

"The Securities and Exchange Commission supports changes in the law that would limit how much foreign investors may borrow to buy stocks, putting them on an equal footing with American investors, an SEC commissioner said yesterday.</br></br>Testifying before a Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs subcommittee, Philip A.

One, introduced by Sen. Al-fonse M. D‰ÛªAmato (R-N.Y.), would extend U.S. margin requirements to foreign investors. The margin requirements allow potential investors to borrow only 50 percent of the value of the stock they seek to acquire.</br></br>Another bill, introduced by Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.), would impose the margin requirement only on investors seeking to buy 5 percent or more of a company‰Ûªs stock. The Kassebaum bill also would im- pose a nine-month moratorium on acquisitions of more than 5 percent of the voting stock of any U.S. energy corporation by Canadian investors.</br></br>Both proposed pieces of legislation are in response to Canadian restrictions on U.S. investment there and recent takeovers or attempted takeovers of American firms by Canadian companies. Witnesses protested that the Canadian companies have been able to borrow 100 percent of the purchase price to buy control of American companies, even in cases where the acquiring firm was significantly smaller than its target."

"THE HOUSE Democrats are developing a shrewd and interesting response to President Reagan‰Ûªs economic strategy. Chairman James Jones of the Budget Committee, with the support of the Democratic leadership, has now brought out his counter-budget. Acknowledging the public demands for greater discipline in spending, they have gone as far as the president in cutting present spending‰ÛÓalthough they have distributed the cuts differently. It‰Ûªs the sweeping reductions in taxes that are the vulnerable part of the Reagan plan, and there the Democrats are challenging him directly. This debate will refine the country‰Ûªs ideas not only about budgets but also about the deeper things that budgets only reflect, the ties of mutual obligation that hold this vast, disparate country together.</br></br>The Democrats have now made a central issue of the size of Mr. Reagan‰Ûªs budget deficit. It‰Ûªs a line of attack calculated to shake some of the administration‰Ûªs conservative support, especially in the Senate where there was already a good deal of uneasiness on that point. The deficit is hardly the only budget number that counts‰ÛÓbut neither is it totally irrelevant, as some of the supply-siders are currently arguing.</br></br>The federal deficit was rolling along at nearly $60 billion when Mr. Reagan took office. For all of the talk of fiscal rigor, the Reagan plan would not push it below $45 billion until the end of 1982, almost halfway through this presidential term. Even that number assumes all of the administration‰Ûªs most optimistic figures, with no nasty surprises like oil crises along the way. By most other people‰Ûªs calculations, the deficit would actually be rising, rather than falling, next year. The Democrats, proposing a smaller tax reduction, would hold that deficit to half the size that Mr. Reagan has projected. They are forcing the Republicans into the embarrassing position of defending another year of heavy deficit spending.</br></br>It‰Ûªs not only a budget that‰Ûªs being hammered together here. It‰Ûªs a program for the Democratic Party as well. The program, in this first draft, calls for stronger social intervention‰ÛÓin nutrition, job training, legal aid and all the rest‰ÛÓthan the administration will accept. The Democrats would accelerate defense spending rapidly, but not quite so rapidly as Mr. Reagan intends to do. Above all, the Democrats ‰ÛÓfollowing a trend that has been visible for a couple of years‰ÛÓare now claiming to be the party of fiscal caution and conservatism, putting a balanced budget before a huge three-year series of tax reductions. They are trying to depict the Republicans as the party that‰Ûªs willing to take great risks with big deficits and untested tax theories. The tax bill is now the pivot on which the whole fiscal issue will turn, and perhaps the next congressional elections as well.</br></br>THE WHITE HOUSE said last week that it intends to nominate energy department official Shelby Brewer to be assistant secretary for the nuclear programs.

"Things are better in the bond markets, but maybe not good enough for the Federal Reserve, which meets tomorrow to set the future of interest rates.</br></br>Traders and investors in various parts of the bond market have had much to cheer in recent days. Liquidity, or the ease of trading, has substantially improved in many sectors since the Fed cut interest rates Oct. 15. And the difference in yields between risky bonds and safer Treasurys has narrowed, indicating investors feel more comfortable with riskier assets, helping to avert what seemed like a looming credit crunch.</br></br>Issuance of corporate bonds is suddenly back on track, highlighted by Sprint Corp.'s sale of $5 billion in bonds last week, the second-biggest corporate-bond deal on record. The issuance followed the successful sale of $4.8 billion of bonds by Associates Corp. of North America, a unit of Associates First Capital Corp., on Oct. 27.</br></br>Meanwhile, money began to flow in the past two weeks into high-yield and emerging-market bond funds, which could lead to higher bond prices -- and thus, lower yields -- in the months ahead.</br></br>In addition to the vast improvements in the credit markets, Friday's reports of stronger-than-expected increases in retail sales and producer prices make it less likely the Fed will cut interest rates when it meets tomorrow."
"NEW DELHI--India's central bank should intervene in the foreign-exchange market to stabilize the rupee, two senior advisers to the prime minister said Wednesday, as the local unit tumbled to a fresh record low against the U.S. dollar for a third straight session.</br></br>The comments from C.

"FOR A TIME, there was a reassuring story to tell about the stock market and the economy. Stocks rose in a speculative frenzy, and then fell. But the U.S. economy recovered surprisingly quickly from Sept. 11, aided by the irrepressible American impulse to shop, plus a round of interest-rate cutting. The market was sick. The economy wasn't. Silicon Valley paper millionaires stopped buying Porsches. The rest of us kept buying Chevrolets.</br></br>The magnitude, the speed and the circumstances of the stock-market decline are threatening that comforting story. Unless the market touches bottom soon -- and despite yesterday's spectacular bounce in stock prices, there is no assurance of that -- it is going to yank the economy down with it.</br></br>We may not sink back into recession. But if we have a few more bad weeks on Wall Street, you can rip up those forecasts about the economy growing at a 3.5% annual pace in the second half. Instead, the economy will slow so much that unemployment starts climbing again and the much-delayed resumption of business capital spending will be delayed still further.</br></br>History offers lots of lessons at a time like this. It's just hard to tell which ones to apply. After the 1987 stock-market crash, consumers paused for a bit, but the economy barely faltered. In 1998, the stock market dropped, and two fantastic years followed. Seven of the 14 bear markets since 1929 didn't coincide with recessions. But seven did, and the damage that a bursting bubble did to Japan is a reminder of how badly things can go awry even in a wealthy, modern economy.</br></br>The economic fundamentals in the U.S. are still strong. The White House and Alan Greenspan are right about that; they aren't mindlessly reciting Herbert Hoover's memoirs. The very resilience of the U.S. economy, so far, has been impressive. And technology's productivity-producing benefits haven't evaporated with all those dot-coms."
"Economist Bill Helming runs a small consulting service in Shawnee Mission, Kans. His clients include major food companies, banks, supermarket chains, feed-lot operators and farmers. Of 80 economists surveyed recently by the Blue Chip Economic Indicators-a newsletter that follows economic forecasts-Helming is the gloomiest. He's predicting recession. In 1990, unemployment would average 6.5 percent, up from March's 5 percent. And the economy's output of goods and services (gross national product) would drop 1.5 percent.</br></br>What this country could use is a modest recession to reverse rising inflation. Chances are you won't read that elsewhere. In polite society, almost no one admits that recessions are inevitable and sometimes desirable. What's unmentionable, though, happens to be true. Outside of wartime-when people may tolerate wage and price controls-periodic recessions have been the only practical way of containing inflation. It's a truth worth remembering as the 1980s' economic expansion (now in its seventh year) enters its final stages.</br></br>There are multiplying signs of strains. By every indicator (consumer prices, producer prices and labor costs), inflation is increasing. Since last spring the Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates more than 3 percentage points. Although unemployment remains low, some of the zip is going out of the economy. Auto sales are dropping. Home buying is declining and increases in retail sales have been small. But the Fed does not say for a moment that it's trying to engineer a recession, and few private economists dare predict one.</br></br>Analysts like Helming are the exceptions. The typical forecaster anticipates a relatively harmless slowdown. Of the forecasts regularly followed by the ""blue chip"" newsletter, the average calls for economic growth (the increase in GNP) of 2.7 percent in 1989 and 1.7 percent in 1990, compared with 3.9 percent in 1988. This is what the Fed says it wants: in the""What this country could use is a modest recession to reverse rising inflation."" current jargon, a ""soft landing"" that will somehow disarm inflation.</br></br>On paper, the strategy could work. In practice, the odds are against it. The process by which inflation relents is no great mystery. Higher unemployment relieves pressures for steeper wage increases. Excess inventories, idle factory capacity and ample supplies of commodities (such as grains, metals and chemicals) weaken price pressures. If slower growth doesn't produce these conditions, inflation almost certainly won't abate. It could get worse. That's the danger, because both consumer prices and labor costs are already advancing at a rate of about 5 percent annually."
"Okay, you're probably thinking that sounds outrageous, so let me take it down a bit. How about a 10-year auto loan?</br></br>If you're financing the purchase of a car with the equity in your home, that is exactly what you could be doing -- paying for a car over 10 or even 30 years.</br></br>The use of home-equity loans, lines of credit and cash-out refinancing to purchase automobiles grew in the last decade as interest rates dropped and property values soared. It also has become popular as lenders hype the fact that interest on a home loan is tax-deductible, unlike interest on a vehicle loan.</br></br>In 2006, about 24 percent of homeowners used a home equity line of credit to purchase a car or truck, according to Synergistics Research, a financial services market research company based in Chamblee, Ga. About 8 percent of homeowners took out a second mortgage specifically to buy a vehicle, says William H. McCracken, chief executive of Synergistics.</br></br>But is buying a car or paying off your remaining auto loan balance with the borrowed equity from your home a good financial move? ""I issue a note of caution on this,"" says Don Taylor, a columnist for Bankrate.com and an associate professor of finance at the American College in Bryn Mawr, Pa. ""If you don't have the discipline to do more than the minimum payments on these loans, then this is not a good idea."""
"AT THE MEETING here about ten days ago of the power-packed Business Council, President Johnson said that both management and labor would have to behave themselves next year to prevent a new cycle of wage-price inflation.</br></br>At that point, B. F. Goodrich President J. Ward Keener asked a question on behalf of every other U.S. business leader: would the President be as tough on labor as on business?</br></br>The President naturally said that he could and would be. And there is little doubt that he would like to be as evenheaded with the George Meanys and I. W. Abels as with the Ward Keeners and Roger Bloughs.</br></br>But the fact of the matter is that the President can‰Ûªt afford to alienate labor as he heads into a tough campaign year in 1968. After a temporary rupture in relationships, labor is back on the John- son team. And despite misgivings here and there in individual unions, the AFL-CIO on a national basis is giving Johnson whole-hearted support on Vietnam.</br></br>THE RENEWED mutuality of interest between Johnson and Meany was evident during the President‰Ûªs appearance last week at the AFL-CIO convention at Bal Barbour, Fla.

"With the exquisite timing of a master politician, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan last week thrust himself into the middle of what has become a raging debate over the near-term prospects for the U.S. economy.</br></br>Will the U.S. economy be able to manage a soft landing from the heights of spectacular and speculative growth of the past two years, as Greenspan had hoped when he initiated a series of interest-rate increases last year? Or has the economy now slowed so far so fast in the past few months that a recessionary hard landing is as likely as not?</br></br>Back in 1996, Greenspan had warned Wall Street of an ""irrational exuberance"" that, if not contained, could eventually derail the American economy. His plea for moderation, while widely noted, was also widely ignored, and the Fed was forced to step in last year and raise interest rates in an effort to slow U.S economic growth to a less threatening pace.</br></br>Now, four years later to the day, Greenspan was in New York before a group of bankers pleading for moderation once again. This time his concern was about an irrational foreboding that seems to have gripped Wall Street, which Greenspan warned could be a self-fulfilling prophecy if investors refuse to invest and lenders refuse to lend. Signaling an imminent change in Fed policy later this month, he hinted that the Fed was ready to cut interest rates at the first credible signs that the economy was headed for a crash landing.</br></br>Although Greenspan's calming words triggered a brief rally in the financial markets, they were quickly drowned out by another wave of gloomy news coming out of corporate America--bad-loan problems at the country's biggest bank, declining sales of personal computers and computer chips, and holiday shutdowns of many of the nation's auto plants.

"that has produced more tedious, predictable and repetitive musings over the years than the institution of the vice presidency has. But offhand we can‰Ûªt think of it. The only good thing to be said about this periodic outburst of interest that invariably manifests itself in disinterment of the same quotations from John Nance Garner and aphorisms and perplexities is that it only happens every four years. But it is our sad duty to inform you that it is that time again. Your four years are up.</br></br>So let‰Ûªs get started. What is different about the job that Ronald Reagan offered George Bush last night? What, if anything, has been added to the sum total of human knowledge about the vice presidency in the past four years? In Detroit, much of the external aspect of the thing was unchanged. There were the same craven, sickly, sycophantic bows and smiles on the.part of certain of the aspirants for the job whenever the name of the Great Man, the Incomparable One reposing up there in the heavily guarded top floor suite was mentioned. There was the same continuous shifting of certainty from one hot prospect to another with the same collection of after-the-fact justifications of why the moment‰Ûªs favorite would be the candidate‰Ûªs choice.</br></br>But some of the most durable pieties of the classic conversation on this subject have been affected by the Carter-Mondale years. Like Cabinet-government, which this administration also gave at least a modified try, and which turned out to be a truly terrible idea, so too the living‰ÛÓas distinct from dead‰ÛÓvice presidency has been experimented with by the Carter government. By living vice presidency, we mean merely the innovation of actually letting the vice president out of his institutional cage, of trying to substitute useful political and governmental work for the more traditional and much-mocked idleness associated with the office.</br></br>All candidates for president, of course, have pledged to try this out, but only Jimmy Carter has given it a real test. It has sort of, more or less, vaguely worked: Mr. Mondale is incomparably more active.</br></br>more heavily engaged in the staff and policy business of his administration than any vice president we can remember. And he has been spared the familiar vice presidential function (not mentioned explicitly in the Constitution, but derived from things that august document does and doesn‰Ûªt say about the job) of being systematically and unendurably and endlessly tortured by the president and the presidential staff."

The FCC said it denied the request because the rules ""may not even apply"" and the petition wasn't specific enough.

"Author: Jonathan Weisman; Damian Paletta</br></br>WASHINGTON--President Barack Obama's budget proposal is expected to give states a way to collect more payroll taxes from businesses, in an effort to replenish the unemployment-insurance program. The plan could cause controversy at a time when the administration is seeking to mend fences with corporate America.</br></br>The proposal would aim to restock strained state unemployment-insurance trust funds by raising the amount of wages on which companies must pay unemployment taxes to $15,000, more than double the $7,000 in place since 1983.</br></br>The plan, which would take effect in 2014, could increase payroll taxes by as much as $100 billion over a decade, according to a person involved in its construction.</br></br>By proposing to enlarge the pool of wages subject to unemployment taxes, the White House appears to be offering states a more politically palatable way to raise revenues than to boost tax rates.

"""Make Money Without Money."" ""Learn How You Can Create Wealth."" ""Buy Real Estate at Below Market Value With No Money Down.""</br></br>For most people, the appeal is almost irresistible: Using only borrowed money, buy properties from desperate sellers on extremely favorable terms; refinance, sell or rent them and make a killing; parlay the profits into a real-estate empire.</br></br>During the hyperinflationary 1970s, the strategy worked for some shrewd investors, and on occasion it still does. But slower rises in property values, a dearth of desperate sellers and an abundance of unrealistic techniques have rendered the strategy far from a sure thing.</br></br>In fact, for the vast majority of hopeful practitioners, no-money-down ownership is often an unattainable, but costly, dream. The money they spend on how-to seminars, books and tapes will constitute their only big-time real estate investment.

""Do you actually see people getting skinnier?""</br></br>Those investors who do manage to buy no-money-down properties run the risk of getting trapped in negative cash-flow situations created by poor market conditions and lower inflation.

Unable to cut short-term interest rates further, Mr. Bernanke figures that printing $600 billion more to buy bonds will push down long-term interest rates (to spur a bit more borrowing), boost stock prices (to make people wealthier so they spend more) and depress the dollar (to give U.S. exports a lift).</br></br>Justifying last week's move, the Fed pointed to inflation below its 2% target and unemployment well above its ""maximum sustainable employment"" mandate.

Only then did he stumble into his true calling as a professional politician when a member of the infamous Pendergast political machine asked him, on a whim, if he was interested in running for a county judgeship.</br></br>This is the now familiar story of the ‰ÛÏfaded haberdasher‰Û who makes good as the ""accidental"" 33rd president of the United States. For much of his nearly eight years in the White House, however, Truman was ridiculed by the press and buffeted by numerous controversies and not a few petty scandals.

And yet, today his reputation is such that politicians from both parties openly attempt to emulate the straight-talking, no-nonsense demeanor of ""citizen Truman.""</br></br>Two years ago, one of our national storytellers, the sonorously voiced David McCullough, cashed in on the phenomenon with hi3 wildly successful, 1,117-page biography Truman.

Hasn‰Ûªt McCullough said it all? Well, perhaps not Many historians were frustrated by McCullough‰Ûªs refusal to engage with the historiography of the Truman presidency. In separate reviews, historians Alan Brinkley, C. Vann Woodward and Ronald Steel all complained that while McCullough was a ‰ÛÏgreat scene-setter and storyteller‰Û (Steel), he largely ignores historical controversies‰Û such as ‰ÛÏthe vast revisionist literature on the origins of the cold war‰Û (Woodward), the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the founding of the CIA, the outbreak of the Korean War, and the phenomenal growth of the military budget during the Truman presidency. McCul- lough was guilty of hagiography, which may not be such a terrible crime for a biographer; but his work cannot be called critical history.</br></br>Ferrell also admires Truman, as much, if not more so, than McCullough.

"As an April 30 deadline looms, the tom-toms of trade war are once again beating at George Bush to take a ""Super 301"" swipe at Japan, and maybe South Korea too. It's time to repeat that the conventional wisdom on trade deficits has it all exactly backward.</br></br>The U.S. does not have a trade deficit with Japan because this country consumes too much and must therefore borrow to pay the bill. The trade deficit exists because Japan has to find somewhere to invest its huge pool of savings. The United States, which happens to be a very good place to invest, then buys Toyotas to recycle those savings back to Japan through the trade account. In other words, the trade deficit is a sign of American economic vigor, not weakness.</br></br>We know this may sound startling, because the conventional wisdom has deemed that somehow there is a perfect trade ""balance,"" presumably at or close to zero. This logic ignores the central truth of foreign trade flows: There can't be a trade deficit without offsetting capital inflows. The trade deficit or surplus is merely an accounting identity.</br></br>To refresh some memories on this point, it's worth reprinting the 1976 conclusions of the U.S. Advisory Committee on the Presentation of Balance of Payments Statistics. This was not a group of economic yahoos, but included Morgan Guaranty's Rimmer de Vries, Brookings's Walter Salant and Charles Schwartz of the International Monetary Fund. The committee said:</br></br>""The words `surplus' and `deficit' should be avoided insofar as possible. . . .

A similar move had provoked an April walkout by the chief U.S. delegate at the negotiations, Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed.

But there could be an element of greed, too, as banks try to make up for losses on Third World loans.</br></br>Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Board is keeping an eagle eye on the recent slide of the dollar. A depreciated dollar helps exports, but it has two negative aspects: it threatens new inflation stemming from the higher cost of imported goods, and it also can discourage the flow of foreign investment necessary to finance the national budget deficit. The Fed is walking a tightrope between the desirability of low interest rates to spur domestic expansion and higher interest rates to prop up the dollar.</br></br>Unless he gets help on the deficit-control side from fiscal policy, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan plainly warned in recent testimony, he may have no choice but to opt for higher interest rates.</br></br>That could choke off an already tiring, six-year domestic expansion and confront the Bush administration with sudden recession. Higher interest rates would also compound massive problems in the battered savings and loan industry, already losing $1 billion every month."
"WITH Chelsea Property Group Inc.'s business driven by two things heavily impacted by the Sept. 11 attacks -- tourism and retail sales -- one might expect the outlet-center owner's stock to plummet and the company to lower its earnings projection.</br></br>But surprisingly, the company has emerged as one of a small number of real-estate investment trusts this year to publicly announce satisfaction with earlier earnings projections. And its total return -- stock price plus dividend paid to shareholders -- has risen 5% since trading resumed after Sept. 11, according to the Morgan Stanley REIT index. REITs overall have risen an average 4% in the same period.</br></br>To be sure, the Roseland, N.J., REIT looks especially vulnerable, as fears of flying keep would-be travelers -- and shoppers -- home and as the economy has sunk into a recession. But investors seem to be focusing more on Chelsea's earnings, which have risen, than on same-space sales, which have fallen. Chelsea reported 9% growth in per-share, third-quarter funds from operations, a commonly used measure of REITs' financial performance, beating analysts' estimates compiled by Thomson Financial/First Call.</br></br>In addition, company officials expect an immediate earnings boost from Chelsea's $180 million acquisition of 31 retail properties from Konover Property Trust Inc., Raleigh, N.C. The deal was completed Sept. 25.</br></br>""It's a good news, bad news thing,"" says Lee Schalop, analyst at Banc of America Securities in New York, with the good news winning out. ""They have some bad news on sales but they bought some assets at incredibly attractive prices, with extremely high returns. Those high returns will flow through their bottom line in 2002."""
"Author: Mark Gongloff</br></br>Bonds continue to trounce stocks, sending mixed signals to investors and raising the question: Are stocks too cheap or are bonds too expensive?</br></br>After consistently lagging behind bond performance this year, stocks appear historically cheap compared with bonds, offering investors reason to favor stocks, particularly if they are optimistic about the economic outlook. But stocks may be cheap because the outlook is dim, meaning bonds--from Treasurys to corporate debt--could continue to outperform for the foreseeable future.</br></br>So far this year, the stock market's total return is slightly negative, while normally staid investment-grade corporate bond returns are up nearly 8%, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Even risk-free Treasury returns are up 6%.</br></br>Stocks made up some ground with a 7.1% rally in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in July. But such stock rallies have stalled repeatedly in recent months as weak economic data have outweighed signs of hope from corporate earnings. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has dropped below 3% as investors scramble for safe havens, and the demand for corporate bonds is booming."

Willard Wirtz called it ‰ÛÏa landmark national effort designed to help the hardest employment cases on a person to person basis.‰Û</br></br>Assistance includes orientation and personal counselling and then referral to jobs; training programs, schools or a combination of all three, the department said.</br></br>Counsellors will follow up the progress of those pratici-pating even after they get jobs.

"In a significant concession to the growing number of investors buying and selling at lightning speed, asset-management giant Vanguard Group said it will add new mutual-fund products that trade throughout the day like a stock.</br></br>The decision to seek Securities and Exchange Commission approval for the new investment vehicles comes after months of hand wringing at the nation's second-largest mutual-fund firm. During the past year or so, low-cost exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, have surged in popularity on the American Stock Exchange, threatening to steal business from Vanguard's franchise index funds. ETFs are a hybrid version of index mutual funds that can be bought or sold during the day at market prices instead of at the once-daily 4 p.m. price used by traditional mutual funds.</br></br>The new Vanguard ETFs will compete with upstart ETFs offered by State Street Corp.'s State Street Global Advisors and Barclays PLC's Barclays Global Investors, among others. Vanguard, based in Malvern, Pa., studied the easily traded products for years, and began seriously considering them as an add-on to their traditional index mutual funds about a year ago.</br></br>Industry observers said Vanguard's entry could prompt other fund companies to add ETFs to their traditional index funds. ""It's really a case of Vanguard's premier brand name putting the Good Housekeeping seal of approval on exchange-traded funds,"" said Burt Greenwald, a mutual-fund consultant in Philadelphia.</br></br>The new products, to be called Viper shares and listed on the American exchange, will be added as a new share class to five of the company's most prominent index funds: the $105 billion-in-assets Vanguard 500 Index Fund, the $19 billion Vanguard Total Stock Market Fund, the $16 billion Vanguard Growth Index Fund, the $4 billion Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund and the $3 billion Vanguard Value Index Fund. Pending regulatory approval by the SEC, the new share class will be introduced during the third quarter, a Vanguard spokesman said."

"President Obama will meet directly with credit card executives this week and plans to tell them to support strict measures that curb lending abuses or face the wrath of angry consumers and a determined Congress, according to banking industry officials.</br></br>The heads of the credit card divisions at 14 major banks are set to meet with the president and his top economic officials at the White House on Thursday, administration aides confirmed yesterday. They are bracing for a warning that the president will join the chorus of condemnation if they resist efforts to protect their credit card customers from unfair practices.</br></br>The high-profile meeting comes as members of Congress launch new efforts to crack down on credit card companies for such practices as arbitrarily raising interest rates on existing balances, charging late fees when enough time was not given between the billing and due dates, and charging interest on debt that was paid on time.</br></br>Lawmakers in the House plan to begin work tomorrow on a bill that would codify new Federal Reserve regulations aimed at curbing those practices. A separate bill in the Senate, sponsored by Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), would go even further, prohibiting companies from applying a variety of charges. The measure includes capping over-limit fees at one per billing period, allowing no interest charges on fees and no fees to make a payment. The legislation also would prevent companies from raising interest rates at any time for any reason and limit aggressive marketing by card issuers aimed at borrowers under 21.</br></br>Industry sources said the president will tell the executives on Thursday that he wants to go further than the House bill without specifically endorsing all of the provisions of Dodd's bill. Administration officials confirmed that the president will push for stronger rules in some areas than those proposed in the legislation but is ""broadly supportive"" of the bills working their way through Congress."
"House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said yesterday it appears unlikely Congress will vote on a major tax-relief package this year, largely because of strong opposition from President Bush and House Republicans.</br></br>However, Democratic and Republican congressional leaders made headway yesterday in fashioning a compromise bill to provide extended benefits to millions of unemployed workers who have exhausted their unemployment insurance, according to sources.</br></br>Negotiators are focusing on a proposal by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) to cover about two-thirds of the $5.2 billion cost of the unemployment benefits by closing a loophole for upper-income people who make quarterly estimated payments of their income tax.</br></br>Foley pledged yesterday to push through another unemployment insurance bill - with or without the administration's support - before Congress adjourns for the year around Thanksgiving, but virtually ruled out action on a major tax bill.</br></br>""It's very clear that the signal has gone out from the White House to resist and oppose any reductions in taxes as a part of dealing with the recovery, or as a part of providing tax fairness,"" Foley told reporters. ""I regret that, but it's very clear that's the case, and under those circumstances the enactment of such a tax bill will be extraordinarily difficult if not impossible."""
"WASHINGTON -- President Clinton made a bold opening bid in the Social Security debate, proposing to invest hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars in the stock market and to create government-sponsored, 401(k)-type individual savings plans for taxpayers.</br></br>""We must help all Americans, from their first day on the job, to save, to invest, to create wealth,"" the president said during his State of the Union address last night.</br></br>The plan, offered in the face of a congressional effort to remove the president from office, drew immediate and harsh criticism from congressional Republicans. But by agreeing to channel Social Security funds into the stock market and advocating individual savings accounts, the president advanced a debate that promises to be one of the most provocative of 1999.</br></br>For Wall Street, the stakes are huge. The Clinton plan and some congressional alternatives would channel between $650 billion and $1.2 trillion of taxpayer dollars into stocks over the next 15 years. At the end of that time, White House officials said, the government would own 4% of the entire U.S. market. A number of Republican alternatives would channel as much money into the stock market, but would do it through individual accounts.</br></br>The amounts being talked about are large but not overwhelming. An investment of $650 billion over 15 years would equal about $3.6 billion in new money a month. By comparison, individual investors have put $1.1 trillion into the stock market since 1991 through mutual funds, or about $11.5 billion a month, according to the Investment Company Institute. Since 1996, those mutual-fund inflows have averaged $17.1 billion a month."
"BONN -- A group of Free Democratic Party campaign workers didn't find many takers when they tried to foist pamphlets and balloons on pedestrians here on the eve of Sunday's election. I asked one of them why the Free Democrats -- the closest thing Germany has to a Thatcherite or Reaganite conservative party -- were attracting so little interest. ""People here don't always like our message,"" he sighed. ""They don't want Germany to be like America.""</br></br>That is an assessment I heard throughout Germany in the run-up to the election. Alarming rates of unemployment and signs that the country is losing its competitive edge have convinced the German people that the welfarist ""social market economy"" that has served them since the end of World War II is seriously ill. But aside from the 6% to 7% of voters who regularly back the FDP, there is little support for a wholesale change of the old system. It is said that the laissez-faire capitalism that has fueled growth in the U.S. is somehow un-German and un-European, a risky experiment with what is perceived to be a uniquely American culture of slums, crime and rampant individualism.</br></br>That mentality -- the desire for change, but only a bit of it -- explains the enormous appeal of Gerhard Schroeder, Germany's new chancellor-elect. He speaks in lofty terms of the future, but the success of his message is in its implication that Germany can reclaim a past when the welfare state seemed to work. The voters screamed for ""change,"" but all they really wanted is the promise of a more functional status quo.</br></br>""This is a conservative country with conservative attitudes,"" says Dieter Roth, a pollster with Forschungsgruppe Wahlen in Mannheim. He means conservative in the European sense: ""The German people want security -- social security. They have been socialized behind the German {economic} model."" Mr. Roth adds that while Germans don't fully believe it is possible to maintain a socialist economy in today's world, Mr. Schroeder has managed to convince the country that it just might be.</br></br>What does this all mean for the future of the world's third-largest economy? Despite Mr. Schroeder's claims, German socialism has seen its last days. Tanglesome regulations, one of the world's heaviest tax burdens and the most expensive labor force in the Western world are eroding the competitiveness of German corporations. The subsequent unemployment is contributing to a rotten culture of dependency. (Sixteen percent of able-bodied Germans are unemployed if you include, as government statistics do not, sources of hidden unemployment, such as those given part-time jobs by the government.)"
"NEW YORK -- If low interest rates are the stock market's fertilizer, the market has been well fed indeed.</br></br>In the past year, short-term interest rates have fallen to around 5% from above 7%. And the stock market, despite a sluggish economy, has risen to near-record levels.</br></br>The average stock in the Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index sells for a price/earnings multiple (P/E) of 20 times the past four quarters' earnings, way above the long-term average of 14 or so. The P/E of the Dow Jones Industrial Average is even higher, at 23.</br></br>To bulls, low interest rates and low inflation justify today's high prices. Puny yields on savings accounts and money funds make stocks relatively more attractive. And low rates might spur economic growth -- again pushing stocks higher.</br></br>But how high? While nobody doubts that lower rates help stocks, a look at history suggests that investors may have overdone it."
"WASHINGTON -- The Labor Department boosted its estimate of non-farm productivity for the second quarter, but the figures are still symptomatic of a sluggish economy.</br></br>Per-hour work output in the non-farm economy rose at a 1% annual rate in the second period, the department said, double the 0.5% rate estimated last month, but still relatively low.</br></br>The change in the figure primarily reflects the revision the Commerce Department announced last week in its second-quarter estimate of the nation's total production, or gross national product. The revision put GNP growth at a modest 2% annual rate, up from the 1.7% rate calculated in July. The Commerce Department said the upward revision mostly was due to a larger-than-expected rise in inventories during June.</br></br>The revised second-quarter productivity gain is based on a 2.2% increase in non-farm output and a 1.2% increase in hours worked. The earlier estimate was based on a 1.9% increase in output and a 1.4% increase in hours. All the figures represent seasonally adjusted annual rates.</br></br>The latest productivity figures continue a pattern of peaks and valleys that characterize economic growth in the later stages of an economic cycle. Productivity generally rises sharply in the early stages of a business recovery and then tapers off as employers hire more workers. Productivity spurted at a 7.1% annual rate in the 1983 second quarter. Lately, as corporations have been reducing the number of employees or cutting their work schedules, productivity has seesawed from quarter to quarter."
"Some mutual-fund companies may make changes to year-end fund prices after a trading glitch caused several companies to publish inaccurate data in recent days.</br></br>Yesterday, the Nasdaq Stock Market, which provides the price listings used by newspapers for more than 10,000 mutual funds, sent a memo to U.S. mutual-fund companies asking them to make any necessary changes to their year-end prices. The move came after a number of fund companies, including giant Fidelity Investments, experienced problems publishing accurate share prices for funds that held the stock of America Online Inc., which experienced year-end price swings on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, the last trading day of 1998. The swings caused confusion among mutual funds over the closing price for AOL that day.</br></br>The problems affected several wellknown funds, including Fidelity's Magellan Fund. In pricing shares of funds that held stock of the Internet company, several fund outfits initially used an incorrect, lower closing price for AOL when distributing per-share fund data to outlets for publication in newspapers and other uses.</br></br>As a result, the price that mutual-fund buyers were charged to purchase funds that held AOL stock was actually higher than the too-low price that appeared in their newspaper fund listings.</br></br>In a memo to fund companies, Nasdaq called on fund groups that may have a problem to ""correct the closing"" net-asset value of funds for 1998. The problem, Nasdaq officials say, is that end-of-year information is important in determining mutual-fund rankings and even tax issues that affect small investors."
"Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker yesterday said that he believes the current pause in the economic expansion likely is temporary and that the Fed will supply enough money and credit to keep the economy growing ""in an orderly way.‰Û</br></br>Volcker, in his first speech since well before the election, told a New York audience, ""A sharp slowing in growth for a time during an expansion period is in fact historically common, typically related to temporary imbalances in inventories following a period of rapid accumulation and temporary fluctuations in consumption. Something of that sort seems to be at work this fall.</br></br>""Continuing growth in income and employment and relatively strong investment plans are reassuring signs for the future,‰Û the Fed chairman said.

"WASHINGTON -- Despite continuing signs of economic momentum, the Federal Reserve still isn't convinced that growth is so strong that it is straining capacity and threatening higher inflation.</br></br>After a two-day meeting that ended Wednesday, the Fed's policy-making committee voted to leave short-term interest rates unchanged. Whether it tightens rates at its next policy session Aug. 20 -- as many economists expect -- depends on what signals the economy sends on prices and growth in the next few weeks.</br></br>""There just wasn't enough evidence yet,"" said Chris Varvares, an economist with Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis forecasting firm. ""Core prices are still decelerating, and there are clear signs that the burst of strength in the second quarter will slow to a more sustainable level during the second half.""</br></br>Over the next six weeks, the Fed will get critical new economic data, beginning this morning with new payroll and unemployment numbers. Also due soon are consumer and wholesale prices, retail sales, wages and the first estimate of total second-quarter growth. Many economists expect that number to exceed a 4% annual rate, compared with 2.2% in the first quarter -- well above the level thought to be sustainable without higher inflation, given today's tight labor markets.</br></br>In their deliberations, Fed policy makers had to look ahead into next year and would have tightened rates if they saw a clear threat of unsustainable growth leading to rising inflation. One factor that may have helped forestall a rate increase was the rising value of the dollar compared with the yen and mark, a rise that will brake the economy by cooling the booming export sector."
"The Nation‰Ûªs chief money manager yesterday acknowledged that the economic advance may have leveled off but said flatly that there is no recession right now.</br></br>Chairman William Mc-Chesney Martin of the Federal Reserve Board gave this appraisal to critical Democrats on the House Banking Committee.</br></br>‰ÛÏI think you can say categorically there is not at the moment a recession, a pause perhaps.

"The phone rings more often these days with requests from friends for information on le gouvernor Dew-coq-kees and his equally mysterious (although more pronounceable) colleagues in the Democratic primaries. European interest rises now that New Hampshire and Super Tuesday have moved the focus to the personalities of a few identifiable frontrunners.</br></br>Foreigners care about our elections in a way that we do not care about theirs. They know that the quirks and whimsies of Occupant, 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, can touch their lives directly because of America's economic and military power.</br></br>The current fashion of talking up an alleged shrinking of American power abroad has not changed this. America's overseas friends and opponents still listen and read more closely during a U.S. campaign than Americans ever would in following an election abroad. They cringe or heave sighs of relief on a regular basis depending on the campaign news.</br></br>The only close equivalent is the kind of attention we rivet on the signs of an open power struggle in the Kremlin, where our fate is implicated. And in years like this one, some Europeans will argue sincerely that the American process is as opaque for them as Kremlin proceedings are for us.</br></br>At a Paris dinner, for example, conversation turns to the two Reverends and their campaigns, which are assumed here to be the endeavors of ego-tripping fringe candidates.

"Do you remember the Equal Rights Amendment? Neither did I until I was reminded of its forgettable nature by two recent Supreme Court decisions. Both concerned the rights of pregnant women. Both illustrated the problematic nature of legislative mandates of equal treatment of the sexes.</br></br>California's fair-employment statute requires employers to provide unpaid leave and reinstatement to employees who become pregnant. A receptionist who took leave and then sought reinstatement was told there was no opening. She complained to the state fair-employment office, but the employer said California's law is inconsistent with and preempted by Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act as amended by the Pregnancy Disability Act (PDA) of 1978.</br></br>The 1964 act banned discrimination on the basis of sex, but in 1976 the Supreme Court held that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy was not sex discrimination under Title VII. So in 1978, Congress brought discrimination on the basis of pregnancy under Title VII.</br></br>The California employer argued that if it complied with California's statute, it would be vulnerable to charges of reverse discrimination brought by temporarily disabled males who do not receive the same entitlement as females disabled by pregnancy. A district court agreed, saying that California's law mandates preferential treatment for females; that Title VII neutrally bans special treatment (i.e., for both sexes), and that state law must yield to federal law.</br></br>But an appeals court reversed, arguing that Title VII does not demand that state laws ""be blind to pregnancy's existence,"" and that Congress only intended to put a floor below which pregnancy disability benefits may not fall, not a ceiling above which they may not rise. Now the Supreme Court has upheld that appeals court and the woman."

The post is considered crucial in the NASD's effort to restore the damage done to its reputation by two ongoing federal investigations.</br></br>The NASD is transferring its regulatory responsibilities to an independent subsidiary in response to criticism that it has been so busy running the Nasdaq market that it has neglected the oversight duties it was given by Congress.</br></br>The Securities and Exchange Commission has served notice that it is preparing disciplinary charges against the NASD based on allegations that Nasdaq traders take advantage of small investors.

"Osama bin Laden said that the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks ""struck deep at the heart of America's economy."" He was wrong. The U.S. economy was scraped and bruised on that terrible day, but it is clear that the heart of the American economy is still beating strongly.</br></br>Despite an estimated $120 billion of damage and a great deal of anxiety, one year after the attacks an economic recovery is underway. In fact, the three-quarter recession that began in early 2001 ended within 45 days of 9/11, and real GDP has now expanded for three consecutive quarters.</br></br>By early October 2001, consumers and businesses were back up and running. After seeing weak sales in mid-September, automobile manufacturers instituted 0% financing and auto sales soared in October to an annualized rate of 21.3 million units, a record high.</br></br>Other retailers experienced similar results. Excluding autos, retail sales fell 1.2% in September, but rebounded by the same 1.2% in October. To complete the pattern, durable goods new orders fell 6.8% in September, only to rebound 9.2% in October.</br></br>Real GDP fell by less (-0.3%) in the third quarter of 2001, which included the impact of the attacks, than it did in the second quarter (-1.6%), just before the attacks. While the airline and hotel industries are still experiencing a depressed level of activity, other spending has not only recovered, but more than offset travel-related losses."
"Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) looks at the growing Social Security surplus and sees tax cuts for the workers of today, not paper cuts in the budget deficit of the 1990s or retirement checks for the aged baby boomers of tomorrow. Economist Barry Bluestone has another view: A pool of spare cash for education loans for college students and older workers.</br></br>Bluestone, who teaches at the University of Massachusetts-Boston, proposes touching the sacred cow of American politics because he foresees multiple benefits for the nation, such as wider access to higher education and job training, stronger international competitiveness and, possibly, a higher balance in Social Security when the elderly population reaches a peak in the next century.</br></br>""People are always jittery when you mention Social Security,"" Bluestone acknowledged. ""We have to get over the initial reaction, which will be, `Woof, not with my Social Security funds.' ""</br></br>He added: ""I don't think there is strong opposition to the program except that it is newfangled. . . . You can't think of a better investment for the Social Security fund . . . than investing in our own people.""</br></br>The proposal, drafted by Bluestone and other academics under the auspices of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, would carve a revolving loan fund out of the Social Security surplus and permit any American to borrow up to $40,000 to finance a college education, apprenticeship or job training. Unlike the main federal student loan program, eligibility would not be need-tested."
"The multibillion-dollar Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) survived its most serious challenge so far in Congress yesterday, saved by some of the Senate's most vocal budget-cutters.</br></br>Thirty-three senators who voted last month against President Clinton's budget package, largely on grounds it did not include enough spending cuts, brushed aside critics' charges that the giant Texas atom smasher amounted to a high-tech ""piece of pork"" and voted to spend $640 million on it next year.</br></br>Among them were Minority Leader Robert J. Dole (R-Kan.), Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) and several Democrats who split with Clinton over the budget, including Sens. J. Bennett Johnston (La.) and David L. Boren (Okla.). The Senate vote was critical because the House earlier had voted 280 to 150 to kill the project and its foes were given a long- shot chance of prevailing in the Senate because of concern over the budget deficit. Opponents picked up 10 votes from last year, but still fell short, largely because so many states share in contracts and other benefits from the project.</br></br>The issue now goes to a House-Senate conference as part of a $22.5 billion spending bill for fiscal 1994 energy and water projects. Faced with a similar clash between the two chambers last year, conferees agreed to continue construction of the SSC.</br></br>The huge project, estimated to cost $10 billion or more when completed over the next decade, is the largest science project in history - a 54-mile tunnel with magnets to force high-speed collision of protons in a way that scientists hope can reveal the nature of matter and other mysteries of the universe. Supporters, led by Johnston, in whose state the magnets are being built, described the project as essential to U.S. leadership in scientific breakthroughs and accused its opponents of indulging in ""flat earth"" thinking."
"The U.S. dollar declined against most major foreign currencies yesterday, although the drop was softened when bond prices failed to advance Tuesday's rally.</br></br>The dollar began weakening in Europe as interest rates fell there for dollar deposits. The decline continued in New York trading, which was thin, although the dollar recovered slightly when bond prices began falling. Lower bond prices translate into higher long-term interest yields, which make dollar denominated investments more attractive.

Bush and free-for-all, destructive capitalism while identifying themselves with the new U.S. president's push for economic recovery and social transformation through government spending.</br></br>Similar campaign dynamics could come into play over the next few weeks in Greece, which is now committed to early parliamentary elections, and next spring in Britain, where change at almost any price seems the mood. Like the Democrats in Japan, the outs of the world will cite the American audacity in electing the young, relatively untried Obama as the path to follow in hard times.</br></br>But Japan's upheaval also presents Obama with a significant challenge in Asia. The president will have to walk a fine line in correctly identifying and strengthening the moderates in the new government while containing the coalition's left- and right-wing extremists.</br></br>And the president has done himself no favor at this moment by choosing John Roos, a California lawyer and a mega-fundraiser for Obama in 2008, as his ambassador to Tokyo. Over time, Obama's complicity with Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel in stuffing the most important U.S. embassies with campaign bagmen instead of experienced foreign policy professionals will come back to haunt this White House -- nowhere more so than in Japan."

"The former head trader at a hedge-fund giant settled regulatory allegations that he systematically attempted to manipulate prices of platinum and palladium, a sign that commodities regulators are intensifying efforts to crack down on manipulation in the futures markets.</br></br>Christopher Pia--former head trader at hedge fund Moore Capital and a major player at the fund for 18 years--agreed to pay $1 million to settle civil allegations by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the regulator said in a release Monday. The CFTC alleged that he tried to artificially move futures prices near the very end of daily trading in a maneuver called ""banging the close,"" which involves inundating the market with trading orders. The $1 million penalty is one of the largest ever levied by the CFTC against an individual.</br></br>The settlement comes amid a boom in which the prices of metals and other commodities have skyrocketed, raising concerns at the CFTC about possible manipulation and abusive practices. One way investors bet on commodities is through the futures market, where they enter into contracts to buy or sell raw materials at a set price on a specified date. The CFTC now has a broader mandate and new tools to attack violations in the commodities markets.</br></br>Under the CFTC settlement, the 45-year-old Mr. Pia, once one of the most powerful traders on Wall Street, also agreed to a permanent ban in trading CFTC-regulated products in platinum and palladium, such as futures contracts. He also is banned from trading instruments regulated by the CFTC during the closing period, the final few minutes of trading when settlement prices are determined. Mr. Pia hasn't traded in the contracts involved in the settlement since May 2008, according to a person close to the situation.</br></br>A lawyer for Mr. Pia declined to comment. A spokesman for Mr. Pia said Mr. Pia ""is pleased to have settled with the CFTC in order to put this matter behind him. Pia Capital, his current firm, is committed to abiding by the CFTC Order and to maintaining the highest level of compliance."" He settled without admitting or denying wrongdoing."

Union membership has dropped from 20 percent to 12 percent of all U.S. workers over for the past quarter century.</br></br>The Employee Free Choice Act, which would require employers to recognize unions once a majority of workers sign cards of support, is fiercely opposed by business groups that argue the measure would cost jobs and further weaken the nation's economy.</br></br>Currently, employers can demand that workers hold secret-ballot elections to determine whether to form unions, something labor organizers say allows companies to run campaigns that pressure workers into voting against organizing. At the same time, business leaders say the so-called ""check card"" legislation would deny workers a secret ballot, leaving them vulnerable to being coerced into supporting the formation of a union."

In the Northeast, a shortage of methyl tertiary butyl ether, an additive used to reduce emissions and add octane to gasoline, put pressure on prices. MTBE prices jumped to $1.31 a gallon in October, compared with 70 cents last year, before falling to $1.10 a gallon this month.</br></br>Overall average spot gasoline prices rose five cents nationally, or 6%, according to EIA data.

Citing security concerns, White House officials generally decline to discuss the veep's comings and goings.

Yesterday morning, White House press secretary Ari Fleischer told inquiring reporters: ""I don't have the vice president's location.""</br></br>But now the mystery is solved. The Post's Mike Allen reports that Cheney has spent the past two days hunting pheasant in South Dakota.

"ROLAND, Okla. -- The bill collector called when Clay Stanley, gaunt and suffering from AIDS, lay bedridden in his apartment, back from the hospital after a bout with a viral infection.</br></br>It wasn't about a car or credit card. The call concerned a matter Mr. Stanley, who is 39 years old, says he had long forgotten: student loans he took out two decades before. The private collector, acting on behalf of the U.S. Department of Education, said Mr. Stanley must pay $69 a month or the government would take a larger sum than that each month from his Social Security disability checks, Mr. Stanley recalls. ""I didn't know what to do, so I said 'OK,' "" he says.</br></br>Years after a political outcry over high levels of student-loan defaults, the Education Department has become one of the toughest debt collectors around. Over the past decade, it has won a steadily expanding arsenal to wield against former students who don't repay.</br></br>A 1998 change in federal law, for instance, made it extremely difficult for people to escape student loans through personal bankruptcy. The Education Department also can now seize parts of borrowers' paychecks, tax refunds and Social Security payments without a court order, a power that only the Internal Revenue Service, among federal agencies, regularly wields. Access to a government database of the newly employed has enabled the department to make much more effective use of private collection companies. And it can go after even decades-old student loans, because there's no statute of limitations on them, unlike most consumer debt.</br></br>As a result, the Education Department collected $5.7 billion in defaulted student loans in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, more than twice as much as in 1998. For current loans that go into default, the department now projects it will ultimately retrieve every dollar of principal, plus almost 20% in fees and overdue interest, a prediction few private lenders would be bold enough to make."

Consulting using a careful screening process. It began with the 725 U.S. stocks included at the end of 1998 in the Dow Jones Global Indexes, a family of world-wide stock-market indexes calculated by Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal. L.E.K. eliminated six stocks that hadn't traded for at least a year, producing a list of 719 companies across 94 industries.</br></br>Next, L.E.K. added another 281 corporations, based on market capitalization, that weren't included in the Dow Jones Global Indexes. Again, these companies had to have traded for at least a year; mutual funds were excluded.</br></br>Since the Scoreboard is meant to track stocks incorporated and trading in the U.S., American depositary receipts and foreign stocks -- including shares of companies such as DaimlerChrysler AG that are incorporated abroad but trade in both U.S. and overseas markets -- were generally excluded. But companies were included if, like Carnival Corp., they are incorporated elsewhere but trade primarily or exclusively on U.S. exchanges.</br></br>The additional 281 companies were selected by relying on data from Dow Jones and Media General Financial Services Inc., a unit of Media General Inc., Richmond, Va."

Consumer prices last month rose 0.4%, or 4.8% on an annualized basis. Worse, the so-called core rate of inflation, excluding food and energy prices, last month was up 0.8%, or 9.6% annually. Analysts had expected an increase of 0.3% in the overall consumer price index and only 0.4% in the core rate.</br></br>""The CPI was surprisingly high and that gave the bond market an excuse to take profits,"" said Kenneth Spence, director of the technical analysis group at Salomon Brothers.

"Awinrwtinn nf a Common Currency Could Drive Up Interest Rates in the U.S., Other Industrialized Nations</br></br>The rush toward a monetary union between East and West Germany is sending ripples throughout the interlocked financial markets of the world, raising concerns that the unprecedented development in the heart of Europe could boost interest rates in the United States and other industrial countries.</br></br>In today's world, when rates rise in one major country, they may well go up in other nations as well. While many factors closer to home are more important in determining the interest rate someone pays on a mortgage in the United States, developments such as those in the two Germanys can play a role. In this case, the developments are pushing rates up.</br></br>Large West German government subsidies to East Germany, pent up consumer demand in the goods-starved East and a surge in investment by West German companies in the formerly Communist-controlled state are expected to combine to produce rising rates in West Germany, despite efforts by the West German central bank to keep the situation under control.</br></br>When the startling prospect emerged last week, investors in West Germany‰ÛÓwhose ranks include not just Germans but a host of foreigners as well‰ÛÓimmediately decided it would generate strong inflationary pressures.

"NEW YORK -- A big drop in interest rates triggered a wave of corporate bond refinancings that powered Wall Street investment banks to a record quarter of stock and bond sales.</br></br>But disclosed fees, or the money that Wall Street investment banks earn from underwriting new stocks and bonds, fell far short of a record, largely because the bulk of the quarter's financings were bond issues that typically reap far slimmer fees than stock offerings.</br></br>The volume of domestic stock and bond financings jumped 63% to $472.7 billion during the first quarter, up from $290.7 billion in the same period last year, smashing the previous record of $372.5 billion set in last year's third quarter, according to Securities Data Co., a Newark, N.J. concern that tracks corporate-finance activity.</br></br>If Wall Street investment banks keep up the breakneck pace, total stock and bond volumes could approach the $2 trillion mark this year, far eclipsing the record of $1.3 trillion underwritten in 1997.

"Single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 800,000, down from 818,000 in July, the Commerce Department said this week.</br></br>The August decline was somewhat larger than expected. Most economists had predicted a drop of less than 1 percent. Still, sales had risen 0.4 percent in July and 6.7 percent in June, and August marked the 20th consecutive month of sales above the 700,000 level, the longest such string since 1978-79.</br></br>During the first eight months of the year, sales ran 6 percent ahead of the same period of 1996. The supply of new homes for sale -- 284,000 in August -- was the slimmest in four years and was enough to last just 4.4 months at the current sales rate.</br></br>It's the eighth consecutive month that the nation had a new-home supply that would last less than five months, the longest stretch since 1971. That could be an incentive to builders to continue a healthy construction pace.</br></br>Economists said strong income and job growth have made buyers confident they can handle mortgage payments. And declining mortgage rates are making the payments more affordable."
"THIS WEEK, no less an authority than Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested that many Americans may have the wrong mortgage.</br></br>In a speech to credit unions, Mr. Greenspan said that Federal Reserve Board research showed that ""many homeowners might have saved tens of thousands of dollars had they held adjustable-rate mortgages rather than fixed-rate mortgages during the past decade"" as rates tumbled.</br></br>Yet the more expensive fixed-rate loans accounted for 81% of mortgage originations last year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. That's because most borrowers are risk-averse and fixed- rate mortgages protect them from the possibility that interest rates will rise over the life of the loan.</br></br>The problem is that as home prices soar, choosing a long-term loan is an increasingly costly decision. In the current market, borrowers can cut the rate on their mortgage drastically by opting for an adjustable-rate mortgage instead of a 30-year fixed-rate loan. Currently, rates average 5.71% on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages while they average just 4.53% on mortgages that carry the same rate for the first five years and then adjust yearly, according to HSH Associates, a financial publisher.</br></br>Lenders are increasingly pushing ARMs because they allow buyers to either trim their payments or buy more home for the same payment. At Washington Mutual Inc., ARMs accounted for 55% of home loan applications in the fourth quarter. At a time of rising home prices, the lower start rates on ARMs allow borrowers ""to maximize their buying power,"" says Greg Sayegh, Washington Mutual senior vice president."

"Government workers who think they pay a lot now for health insurance will remember 1995 as the good old days.; A change tentatively approved by Congress would raise premiums for workers and retirees, hitting them much harder than another proposal that has gotten all the attention. That proposal would base annuities on an employee's highest five-year average salary, instead of the current system of using the highest three-year average salary.</br></br>Most federal workers can offset the effect of the change from the so-called high-three to high-five simply by working a little longer. The formula would change incrementally, to high-four in January and then to a high-five system for people retiring in 1998 and thereafter. On the other hand, if the insurance formula is changed, there is nothing workers or retirees can do -- except move to a less expensive, less comprehensive plan -- to escape higher premiums.</br></br>Congress is almost certain to approve a formula change that puts a limit on the government's share of health care premiums for employees and retirees. The kicker is that the limit would rise based on the national inflation rate -- which has been running at or less than 3 percent -- while premiums would rise based on medical inflation rates, which have been running at 7 percent to 8 percent a year over the last decade.</br></br>The government now pays about 72 cents of every premium dollar, a little more or a little less depending on the plan and option workers choose. Blue Cross-Blue Shield's popular standard-option plan costs $81.33 biweekly. The government pays $61 toward that premium, and workers pay $20.33. For HealthPlus, a popular health maintenance organization, the government pays $44.94, and the employee pays $14.98 of the $59.92 biweekly premium.</br></br>That cost-sharing mix will change fast. Next year, thegovernment will pay a flat $1,535 toward the single premium and $3,400 for a family plan. Each year after 1996, that dollar amount will be adjusted according to the Consumer Price Index, which measures inflation. The rate was 2.6 percent in 1994, 3 percent in 1993 and 1992, 4.2 percent in 1991 and 5.4 percent in 1990."
"Sometimes a few facts tell important stories. The American economy now is full of facts that tell stories that you really don't want, but need, to hear.</br></br>Where are we now?</br></br>Did you know that annual spending by the federal government now exceeds the 2007 level by about $1 trillion? With a slow economy, revenues are little changed. The result is an unprecedented string of federal budget deficits, $1.4 trillion in 2009, $1.3 trillion in 2010, $1.3 trillion in 2011, and another $1.2 trillion on the way this year. The four-year increase in borrowing amounts to $55,000 per U.S. household.</br></br>The amount of debt is one thing. The burden of interest payments is another. The Treasury now has a preponderance of its debt issued in very short-term durations, to take advantage of low short-term interest rates. It must frequently refinance this debt which, when added to the current deficit, means Treasury must raise $4 trillion this year alone. So the debt burden will explode when interest rates go up.</br></br>The government has to get the money to finance its spending by taxing or borrowing. While it might be tempting to conclude that we can just tax upper-income people, did you know that the U.S. income tax system is already very progressive? The top 1% pay 37% of all income taxes and 50% pay none."
"HEALTH-CARE COSTS can drop because of corporate ""wellness"" programs.</br></br>Tenneco Inc. reports that insurance claims for exercising women workers in 1983 averaged less than half those of women who didn't exercise.

Besides a drop in health-care costs, the company says, productivity rose. In Houston, Tenneco has a fitness center.</br></br>Shell Oil says its programs are ""cost effective"" for the company.

"With pit traders screaming, ""Go, go, go"" -- and economists sounding alarms -- the world oil benchmark price briefly topped $80 a barrel yesterday for the first time.</br></br>Last year, when crude was at similar levels, prices retreated and the economy stayed resilient. But this year, there are some significant differences, triggering concerns that prices could be headed higher and that the economy could be vulnerable.</br></br>One main distinction: This time around, the economy isn't looking quite as healthy amid concerns about the weakened housing market and mortgage defaults.</br></br>In addition, in 2006, oil inventories were higher because of market incentives to store oil, which meant energy buyers had a stockpile. By contrast, today, different market incentives have led to much lower oil inventories in key regions.</br></br>That's troublesome, because the lack of a stockpile cushion means that any supply crunch could lead buyers -- oil refiners and speculators alike -- to quickly bid up crude-oil prices beyond $80 a barrel, just as the economy appears vulnerable to recession."

"Economic growth slowed significantly in the second quarter while wages increased at the fastest pace since the early 1990s, the government reported yesterday. The news led to a sell-off on Wall Street as investors feared the Federal Reserve was more likely to raise interest rates again.</br></br>At first glance, the slowing in the annual rate of growth in gross domestic product from its 4.3 percent clip in the first three months to 2.3 percent in the spring appeared to be a development that would satisfy Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who has been counting on a chilling of the economy to forestall the need for any further increases in interest rates.</br></br>But financial markets passed over that possibility and instead focused on a 1.1 percent increase in the employment cost index (ECI), a broad measure of wages and benefits. The index rose at a rate greater than the 0.8 percent analysts had expected--and raised the specter of inflationary pressures increasing in an economy that already is experiencing the tightest labor market in decades.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 180.78 points, to 10,791.29, as investors worried that the markets' benign environment of strong economic growth and weak inflation was undergoing a sea change.

"When the 1996 welfare reform bill was being debated in Congress, there were numerous predictions from scholars, editorial page writers and politicians that a welfare system that demanded work, imposed sanctions and operated under time limits would result in huge declines in family income and increases in poverty and homelessness.</br></br>Now comes the U.S. Census Bureau with its data on family income and poverty for 2000, thereby permitting informed judgments about whether welfare reform is driving poor families into the Grate Society. For the seventh year in a row, poverty was down. Further, black and Hispanic households had their lowest poverty rates ever, and the overall child poverty rate was lower than in any year since 1976. Similarly, black and Hispanic households both set records for all-time high incomes.</br></br>How is the nation making such remarkable progress against poverty and low income? The Census Bureau report shows that an important part of the answer is that welfare reform has led to huge increases in work and earnings by single mothers and a revolution in how government helps the poor. No longer does government help the poor primarily by giving them welfare benefits. The new approach is to encourage, cajole and, if necessary, force poor and able-bodied parents to take jobs. Then, once they are employed, government provides help through a system of work supports that includes cash earnings subsidies, primarily through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), medical insurance, food subsidies, child care and housing.</br></br>The Census Bureau data show how this new approach works. Consider the group of about 2 million families headed by mothers with incomes under $13,000. In 1993 this group earned on average only $1,400 and had welfare benefits (primarily cash and food stamps) of $4,400 (all figures are adjusted for inflation). By 2000, their earnings had increased by 130 percent, to $3,100, and their welfare benefits had declined by a quarter to $3,300. In addition, they enjoyed a 300 percent increase in EITC income. The net effect was that total income for these mothers and children rose by a quarter, to $8,600.</br></br>Now consider the group of 2 million mothers with incomes between $13,000 and $21,000, a group that includes many mothers leaving welfare. Earnings increased from $4,900 in 1993 to $11,700 in 2000. Similarly, EITC income increased by nearly 200 percent. Although the welfare income of mothers in this group fell by nearly 60 percent, their total income increased by more than $4,000, to $17,600."
"First Union Corp., responding to an attack by SunTrust Banks Inc., denied that the use of a tax shelter might force First Union to add to its level of reserves, a move that would decrease future earnings.</br></br>In a statement Tuesday, First Union said SunTrust had issued ""false and irresponsible allegations."" It continued, ""We are disgusted.""</br></br>The two banks are fighting to buy Wachovia Corp., a Winston-Salem, N.C., bank with valuable Southeast market share. First Union made a $14.35 billion friendly bid for Wachovia in mid-April. SunTrust, which sought a merger with Wachovia in December only to be rebuffed, responded to First Union's offer in May with a $14.65 billion hostile bid.</br></br>First Union, Charlotte, N.C., and SunTrust, Atlanta, have traded barbs since. SunTrust on Monday upped the ante in a letter to the Federal Reserve System, alleging that First Union used a controversial tax vehicle to avoid paying billions of dollars in taxes.</br></br>SunTrust's letter left some analysts and investors surprised at the extent to which SunTrust, once considered a genteel Southern bank, went to discredit First Union. ""It is certainly very close to, if not over the line,"" said Harold Schroeder, who follows financial-institution stocks for hedge fund Carlson Capital in Dallas.

"WASHINGTON -- The House approved a $282.6 billion measure to fund the nation's defense in the coming fiscal year.</br></br>The bill, which passed on a 360-53 vote, would fund all Pentagon operations for the year beginning Oct. 1 except military construction projects, civil defense and nuclear warheads, which are covered by other legislation. A defense-spending bill is pending in the Senate.</br></br>The measure moved through the House with uncommon harmony, as lawmakers avoided fights over arms-control provisions that have embroiled defense-spending bills in previous years. This year, that battle is being waged in the Pentagon authorization bill, which is currently being considered by a House-Senate conference committee. Authorizing legislation defines which programs the government may carry out and sets spending ceilings for those programs, while appropriating legislation funds the programs.</br></br>The House spending bill represents a 1.4% decrease in defense spending from current levels, after inflation is taken into account. The legislation would give the Pentagon $556.6 million less than the Reagan administration had requested and make changes in spending priorities.</br></br>Research into the president's Strategic Defense Initiative, for instance, would be funded at $3.2 billion under the bill, $400 million less than current spending and $1.3 billion less than the administration request. National Security Adviser Colin Powell has said he would advise Mr. Reagan to veto any bill that makes ""crippling"" cuts to the program."
"WASHINGTON -- President Clinton may be struggling with the outcry over his appointments and his $200 haircut, but he is generating big business for one segment of the economy -- political humorists.</br></br>""There's no recession in the comedy industry,"" says Elaina Newport, a writer-performer for the musical comedy group The Capitol Steps. The Capitol Steps performed 350 live shows in 42 states last year, and business is ""up 12% from last year,"" Ms. Newport says. The group just wrote a song dedicated to dropped Clinton appointee Lani Guinier called: ""When Lani Goes Marching Home Again.""</br></br>Political comedy, once considered too narrow to sell outside the Washington Beltway, now has Washington performers taking to the road, often performing at functions for companies and trade groups. Political humor ""has never been more popular,"" says John Simmons of Gross National Product, a group that performs a show called ""Clintoons.""</br></br>Gross National Product performed for private and public groups 207 times in 1992; that number has already been surpassed this year, Mr. Simmons says. GNP does skits about whatever is in the news, and the group rewrites the jokes every weekend. ""The reason I picked David Gergen as my new director of communications is we found out that George Stephanopoulos is only 13,"" cracks Bob Heck, the actor playing President Clinton. ""We were violating child labor laws.""</br></br>Comedian Mark Russell, who once performed his topical jokes and songs almost exclusively in Washington, now is on the road 200 days a year before such groups as the American Association of Retired Persons.

""Less than 30 years ago the network news lasted 15 minutes. Now we're swamped with it,"" Mr. Russell says."
"There were no Christmas miracles for retailers yesterday as the holiday shopping season officially got underway.</br></br>Pent-up demand could have sent retail sales skyward. Or the economic crisis could have kept them in the red. It was all up to the throngs of shivering shoppers waiting in the dark, cold morning. Would they buy that $598 flat-panel television or a $379.99 Toshiba laptop? ""I would describe the customers as hit-and-run shoppers,"" said C. Britt Beemer, chairman of America's Research Group, a consumer behavior research firm. ""They went in, they got the deal and they left. If the deal was sold out, they left without anything.""</br></br>The day after Thanksgiving -- commonly called Black Friday -- is a key barometer of holiday spending, when retailers traditionally turn a profit. Retailers managed to rouse many shoppers out of bed through aggressive discounts in key categories such as electronics, toys and apparel, but consumers kept a close eye on their own bottom lines.</br></br>Economists are closely watching this holiday season because the depth of the financial slowdown could depend on consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70 percent of the gross domestic product. The next few weeks are also a make-or-break period for retailers because they count on holiday sales to help pay their costs the rest of the year.</br></br>""With the news of the economy, I wasn't certain of what to expect today,"" said Chris Poleto, general manager of Fair Oaks Mall.

"Japan is America's number-one student. Unfortunately the lesson that it has been learning in recent years is a bad one: how to grow rich through greed.</br></br>As a result, the current Japanese prosperity, which pushed the Tokyo stock market to new highs last week, is, like the current United States prosperity, built upon a rickety foundation. In Japan that foundation is propped up by a superheated real estate market. In the United States the prop is a set of government policies that have made the dollar cheap and interest rates high. These supports could easily collapse with a thud heard from Bangkok to Bangor.</br></br>Despite the odds and the economists' predictions, the eight years of the Reagan administration have seen unprecedented economic growth in the free world. That prosperity, however, led by Japan and the United States, has been brought about largely by borrowing from the future. Greed, based on unrealistic expectations of the durability of short-term results, has acquired a momentum far beyond our ability to control it rationally. Government, corporations and individuals in both countries have collateralized their future, and borrowed against it, to generate cash to enjoy now.</br></br>The borrowing phenomenon is not, of course, new to the western world, but the extent and level of the credit society are unprecedented. Both the United States and Japan now spend approximately one-quarter of their government revenue just to pay the interest on their deficit-financing securities.</br></br>America's prodigality has been the subject of much learned as well as popular discussion. Less well understood, however, is the degree to which Japan has become similarly infected. Japan's corporations are now issuing stocks priced at 60 to 80 times earnings, compared with an average multiple of about 20 on the New York Stock Exchange. As a result, capital in Japan has become virtually free. Japan's consumers also have learned the use of plastic money-some 1.2 billion cards have been issued to an income-earning population of only 42 million."

He also moved to fire two of the operators' direct supervisors, one of whom is a police officer, and urged that two more supervisors face sanctions.</br></br>The chief's actions cover four of the five supervisors and five of 13 operators working at the city's emergency communications center the morning of the fire -- meaning that, in his view, half the police staff handling 911 calls during that shift made mistakes.</br></br>""It is a very serious issue, and I think we're taking it very seriously,"" Ramsey said yesterday. He said that 911 is ""literally a lifeline to the community, and people need to take it seriously. You never know when that call is going to come in.""</br></br>Ramsey's announcement marked another step in retreat by city officials, who at first denied that problems with 911 had delayed their response to the predawn fire that killed Christopher Smith, 24. Since then, they have acknowledged that neither the police department nor the fire department had enough operators answering 911 calls and determined that the first three people who called about the fire were put on hold."

"Charles Krauthammer rebukes the Clinton administration for supporting market-oriented reform in Russia {""It's Their Economy, Stupid,"" op-ed, Feb. 9}. Some valid questions may indeed be raised about the design and efficiency of our aid program for Russia. Certainly, the rhetoric of ""shock therapy,"" ""irreversible change"" and ""strategic partnership,"" originally used to sell Russian reform to the American public was naively romantic. But Krauthammer's proposal to disengage U.S. assistance is misguided.</br></br>Russia is not Cuba or North Korea. A starvation strategy of noncooperation cannot possibly work with Russia. It is too important strategically and has too many nuclear warheads. Active, constructive engagement with Russia is the only responsible option. It is also the best way to address Krauthammer's warning that Russia will follow China's nakedly authoritarian path.</br></br>Engagement must be recognized for what it is. It is not a magic wand. Nor is it a marriage vow. Understood correctly, it should be a strategy of pragmatic cooperation based on expanding spheres of mutual interest.</br></br>Foreign aid to the post-Communist countries, including Russia, has been a tool of U.S. foreign policy. It is a bag of tactical interventions and subventions -- know-how and cash -- to promote desirable political and economic developments. Admittedly, there is more art than science to foreign aid, but over the years we have also learned what does and does not work. For example, trying to ""buy"" elections usually backfires. Trying to impose textbook political and economic models on non-textbook conditions is unwise. Pushing radical reform while ignoring its social consequences (such as unemployment) also is a bad idea, especially if the unemployed get to vote.</br></br>Krauthammer argues that it is simply not in our national interest to help the Russians with their economic travails. Yeltsin, the butcher of Chechnya, has turned out to be a bad guy, so why support him? On the other hand, should Yeltsin lose in next June's presidential election -- a distinct possibility -- it would be better for us if his likely neo-communist successor, Gennady Zyuganov, faced a crippled economy."

"Tuesday night was not a good one for Republican opponents of immigration reform and free trade. Primary races in South Carolina and Utah, respectively, saw protectionism defeated and the forces of rational immigration policy prevail. And by wide margins.</br></br>Incumbent Congressman Chris Cannon of Utah, a vocal supporter of President Bush's guest-worker proposals for aliens, coasted to a 16- point victory over former state legislator Matt Throckmorton, who made immigration the central issue of the campaign.</br></br>The Throckmorton thumping is noteworthy because national anti- immigrant activists -- a motley band of population-control zealots and nativists -- were hoping to make an example of Mr. Cannon and spent tens of thousands of dollars (in a very small media market) trying to unseat him. So divisive has the immigration issue become within the GOP (see Tamar Jacoby's op-ed nearby) that the Congressman even had to ward off direct attacks from a member of his own House caucus. Tom Tancredo of Colorado set up a political action committee and Web site to bash Mr. Cannon and other Republicans trying to fix our broken immigration system.</br></br>Back in South Carolina, Representative Jim DeMint just as easily defeated former Governor David Beasley to win the Republican nomination for the Senate seat being vacated by retiring Democrat Fritz Hollings. Mr. DeMint is a free-trader in a state that not only is trailing the national economic recovery but has lost textile industry jobs to foreign competition. Nevertheless, Mr. DeMint stuck to his pro-growth principles and refuted his protectionist opponent's ""fair-trade agreements"" sophistry. He was rewarded with 59% of the vote.</br></br>The results in Utah and South Carolina should convince Republican candidates that immigration reform and free trade can be political winners -- even in the least likely places. Moreover, these ideals help to define the GOP as a inclusive, pro-growth, forward-looking party."

If such an event sent prices skyrocketing to $60 to $70 a barrel, that would have much more damaging effects, depending on how long they would stay that high and how consumers and businesses would respond.</br></br>""The momentum of the U.S. economy now is so strong that it would have to be a major oil crisis"" to have a big impact, said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist for Global Insight Inc., an economic research firm.</br></br>Crude oil prices would have to rise to around $50 a barrel for at least three to six months to qualify as an economic shock comparable to those of the 1970s, Morgan Stanley chief economist Stephen S.

"U.S. house prices ""likely would have to fall considerably"" to return to a normal relationship with rents, says a study by one former and two current Federal Reserve economists.</br></br>The study, which doesn't necessarily reflect the views of Fed policy makers, suggests prices would have to fall 15% over five years, assuming rents rose 4% a year. House prices would have to fall further if the adjustment took place more quickly.</br></br>The study tracks rents and home prices back to 1960 and found annual rents fluctuated at around 5% to 5.25% of home prices until 1995. At the end of that year, the average monthly rent was about $553 (or about $6,600 a year) and the average home price was about $134,000.</br></br>But starting in 1996, home prices started to grow much more rapidly than rents. By the end of 2006, they had more than doubled to an average of $282,000, while the average rent had risen 48% to $818. That drove the annual rent/price ratio down to 3.48%.</br></br>That means the rent/price ratio is about a third below its long-term average. To return to normal would require some combination of falling prices and rising rents. The paper suggests house prices would need to fall about 3% a year, if rents grew in line with their 4% average annual growth this decade."

But the billionaire investor, who controls most of Sears Holdings stock through his Greenwich, Conn., hedge fund, ESL Investments Inc., has been unable to reverse longstanding sales declines at Sears and Kmart.</br></br>Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year dropped 3.9% at Kmart and 12.5% at Sears. The company attributed the declines to lower clothing sales and the effect of the housing slump on appliance and furniture sales. Sears declined to make Mr. Lampert or company executives available for comment."
"Felix Rohatyn, the investment banker who helped steer New York City out its bankruptcy a decade ago, recently gave the National Press Club a formula for dealing with the escalating savings and loan fiasco.</br></br>Instead of turning the present $130 billion problem into a $500 billion one (through added interest costs over 30 years), Rohatyn proposed a 5 percent temporary increase on tax rates, across the board until the bill is paid off. The surcharge would produce $25 billion to $30 billion a year, winding up the problem in about four years' time and relieving our children from paying ""for our own stupidity.""</br></br>In Omaha, systems analyst Renee Wickes-a Republican who voted for George Bush in 1988-heard Rohatyn's speech over National Public Radio. ""Your comments ... were so practical and reasonable, it seems incredible that our political leaders are not lifting these ideas, repackaging them and proffering them as their brainchild,"" she wrote him.</br></br>But Rohatyn's mailbag, while full of kudos from thoughtful citizens, did not yield a single endorsement from a Washington politician.</br></br>Members of his own Democratic Party resist taking any initiative to raise taxes. Says a prominent congressional Democrat: ""Rohatyn's proposal is a nonstarter. We would have enough trouble raising taxes for more appealing purposes.

"NEW YORK -- History repeats. You just don't expect it to repeat this quickly.</br></br>There are eerie parallels between this week's chaos in global financial markets and the dislocations of the 2008 financial crisis. Yet there are also significant differences, which investors, still smarting from past crisis, should bear in mind.</br></br>But first, the spooky stuff:</br></br>1. As a crisis trigger, Greece is analogous to the subprime mortgages market in 2007, since it also represents a relatively small, low-profile sector of its broader asset class.</br></br>When the Greek government first revised up its budget deficit estimates late last year, few predicted it would eventually put the entire euro zone at risk--much as few foresaw the initial subprime mortgage defaults threatening the entire U.S. financial system."
"AuthorAffiliation Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</br></br>""This is already indicated by the fact that [U.S. trade officials] have suggested if they apply retaliatory measures, it'll only [affect] about $1 billion,"" said William Cline, an economist with the Institute for International Economics. ""The direct effect would be small,"" he said.</br></br>Though European Union and Canadian trade ministers also will be represented at the talks, the auto dispute between the U.S. and Japan is by far the marquee event of this week's ""quadrilateral"" negotiations. The huge auto-trade imbalance is called the biggest glitch in their economic relationship and so, with the dollar at historic lows against the yen and the U.S. trade deficit at record highs, the talks have gained increased relevance.</br></br>U.S. officials say they will make a strong bid for settlement this week. But they insist there can't be one unless Japan agrees to a so-called ""voluntary plan"" for its auto makers to purchase more U.S. car parts. Last week, a Tokyo trade official insisted Japan won't do it.</br></br>""We have lots of room for negotiation and compromise in some areas, but there's no room for compromise on the voluntary plan,"" he said."
"There is a significant risk that Congress will enact legislation this year that will push the economy into recession in 1986. The recovery is approaching its third anniversary and the 33-month average duration of all recoveries. And the statistical evidence leaves no doubt that the recovery has lost the vigor that characterized its first two years. Whether the economy will continue to expand or will slide into recession will depend on what Congress does about tax reform and deficit reduction.</br></br>The easiest way for Congress to push the economy into recession next year would be to accept the administration's proposal to eliminate the investment tax credit on Jan. 1, 1986. Experience shows that the ITC provides a substantial boost to investment in business equipment. Eliminating the ITC would not only reduce the long-term level of investment spending but would have a particularly adverse effect on investment in 1986.</br></br>If it looks as if the ITC is going to be eliminated next January, companies will bring forward to this year as much of their planned 1986 investment as possible in order to take advantage of the ITC while it is still available. When 1986 comes, investment would fall off very sharply, causing a decline in overall demand that could push the economy into recession.</br></br>We will be particularly vulnerable in 1986 to such an adverse shock because, in addition to the natural weakness of a maturing recovery, the economy will be slowed next year by the short-term effects of deficit reduction. Although reducing the deficit will eventually make the economy stronger and healthier, the immediate effect of a cut in government spending will be to reduce demand. The government will spend less on a variety of goods and services, and recipients of transfer payments will have less to spend on consumer goods. The reduction in demand will mean less production and therefore less employment.</br></br>Of course, the reduced deficit will also cause lower interest rates and a more competitive dollar and that in turn will increase investment and net exports. But experience shows that the response of investment and net exports to interest rates and the dollar occurs only with a lag of 12 to 18 months. The 1986 impact of the deficit-reduction legislation is therefore likely to be contractionary."

"NEW YORK -- Long-term interest rates, which tumbled almost a third of a percentage point last week, could ease a bit further before starting to rise again, many investment strategists say.</br></br>A relatively stable dollar and signs that economic activity is slowing from the first quarter's brisk pace ""remove some of the pressure for higher inflation and rates,"" says James Capra, investment strategist at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.

"The last recession seriously eroded equal opportunity for America's black workers.</br></br>Blacks were the only racial group to suffer a net job loss during the 1990-91 economic downturn, at the companies reporting to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Whites, Hispanics and Asians, meanwhile, gained thousands of jobs, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of EEOC records.</br></br>The computer-aided study shows that some of the nation's largest corporations shed black employees at the most disproportionate rate. At Dial Corp., for instance, blacks lost 43.6% of the jobs cut, even though they represented 26.3% of Dial's work force going into the recession. At W.R. Grace & Co., they held 32.2% of the jobs cut, while they accounted for 13.1% of the company's pre-recession payroll.

But some civil-rights advocates argue that something more insidious is going on.</br></br>""This is subconscious, deep-seated racism,"" says George Fraser, who publishes directories of black professionals. ""People don't even know these patterns and behaviors are being initiated until you begin to see the pieces of the puzzle together and look at the numbers."""
"The Japanese government announced today that the world's second-largest economy continued to shrink for an unprecedented fourth quarter in the three months that ended in September, despite a boost from government spending.</br></br>In addition, the government announced that for the first time in its history, the value of the national and local governments' debts will exceed the nation's total economic output at the end of this fiscal year.</br></br>""Basically there is no recovery in sight,"" said Yasuhiko Ushikubo, an economist with the Industrial Bank of Japan.</br></br>The United States and other nations have urged Japan to revive its economy as fears mount that Japan's woes could prolong economic turmoil in Asia and threaten the rest of the global economy.</br></br>Japan's gross domestic product -- the value of all goods and services produced -- contracted 0.7 percent in the July-September period, for an annual rate of 2.6 percent."
"Politicians who complain about ""corporate bosses"" gaining at the expense of ""American workers"" are often accused of engaging in class warfare, which clashes with America's proud self-image as a classless society. But soaring executive compensation amid stagnant pay for average workers, the continuing hangover from a wave of corporate scandals and other realities keep this us-and-them issue very much alive. Indeed, Sen. John Edwards's ""Two Americas"" stump speech is but a polite and politic way of introducing social class and economic power into public discussion.</br></br>But the bipolar view of class and economic interests that shapes this traditional Two Americas view reflects an outdated understanding of the American workplace. For decades, when academics, politicians and others spoke of ""workers,"" they generally meant people who used their hands and backs to produce things. The growth of hotel, restaurant, health care, Wal-Mart and other service sector jobs has not changed this: Real physical work is at the core of what it meant to be a ""worker."" CEOs and other executives, meanwhile, remain atop the economic ladder.</br></br>But I've conducted interviews over the past year with members of a significant and growing segment of American employees who are in the middle of this us-and-them perception. These are middle managers in large corporations, such as loan officers leading a team of lenders, office managers responsible for administrative infrastructure, engineers in charge of teams of software developers, managers of local bank branches, human resources supervisors and many more who form a major, if underrecognized, population: About 7 million employees are now classified as managers, while 11 million employees are production workers.</br></br>These people are not paper pushers who simply clog up a useless bureaucracy. They are people with real skills who care about and enjoy their work and who can make useful things happen. Their skills are concrete, take time to learn and are to some extent portable to other companies. In short, these millions of middle managers are a new kind of craft worker, much like skilled electricians, carpenters and plumbers.</br></br>They are certainly no longer the Organization Man (or Woman) of the 1950s and beyond, who, while conformist and restricted in what they could do, at least tended to have job security. Many of today's middle managers have more opportunity to be creative entrepreneurs within their companies, but, like other workers, they now also tend to have, at best, modest job security. Waves of corporate restructuring have left them vulnerable to layoffs and outsourcing. Also, like other workers, many of these middle managers feel their ""bosses"" are making poor decisions beyond their control and even their understanding. But unlike traditional workers, who use unions or ties to political parties to make their case and press for relief, these middle managers tend to be apolitical and have little sense of alternatives to their insecure world and how politics might reduce their insecurity."
"JOLIET, Ill. -- The most obvious question for workers striking at a Caterpillar Inc. plant here is: Are you crazy?</br></br>The giant maker of construction and mining equipment is known for crushing union opposition. In February, after workers at Caterpillar's locomotive plant in London, Ontario, refused a pay cut, the company closed the factory and eliminated their jobs. In the 1990s, Caterpillar used white-collar staff and temporary workers to operate plants during strikes by the United Auto Workers, who eventually capitulated.</br></br>Now, even though more than 500 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, or IAM, will enter the second week of a strike Tuesday, Caterpillar insists it will maintain production at the Joliet plant, which makes hydraulic parts.</br></br>The strikers are protesting Caterpillar's six-year contract proposal that could freeze pay for many workers, reduce benefits and change work schedules.</br></br>Many workers across the nation, including union members and civil servants, have been swallowing hard and accepting reduced benefits, flat or declining wages and higher health-care costs as companies and state and local governments search for savings. States with lower wages and restrictions on unions are attracting new plants. Union power is declining."

'</br></br>WHERE‰ÛªS THE INFLATION coming from? The current surge of prices and anxieties tempts people to grasp at the one-sentence explanations and the short, snappy remedies. There‰Ûªs the theory that blames it all on federal deficits. Another view holds that inflation is all diie to mismanagement of the money supply. A third attributes it to OPEC and oil prices.	' -""All of those things have contributed to inflation fjrom time to time over the years. None of them is the single crucial source of the trouble. The technical economic analyses never quite reach the heart of the matter. At its present stage, the inflation is rooted mainly in public attitudes. Not only the government but Americans throughout the country want better performance out of the economy than it is capable of giving. They want lower employment and better housing and bigger pensions and faster growth, simultaneously, than the great machine can provide.</br></br>Living in, a highly organized society, Americans have become skilled at protecting themselves from inflation. The cost of living has risen 10 percent in the past year, and people think it only fair that their incomes should go up 10 percent to compensate them. To the extent that people succeed in recapturing that 10 percent, it will turn up again in the months ahead in somebody else‰Ûªs costs and the inflation will continue.</br></br>""To keep the inflation rate at zero, every rising price has to be balanced by a falling price somewhere else.</br></br>When any worker manages to push his wages up faster than his productivity, some other worker‰Ûªs wage has to fall. But most American producers have a ratchet on their prices, and wage cuts are almost unknown. President Carter‰Ûªs wage and price guidelines are a brave attempt to hold everybody to increases that are a little below the inflation rate, to distribute the burden as widely as possible. While the guidelines are better than nothing, they are hardly proving a miracle."
"A dreary jobs report released last week has driven home what most political insiders already thought: The presidential election of 2012 will be largely about the economy, particularly how high the unemployment rate is on Election Day.</br></br>Yet joblessness is an incomplete and inadequate measure of a broader economic malaise that forms the real backdrop for the coming campaign.</br></br>The deeper problem -- the one that feeds a sense of economic dissatisfaction and anxiety in the land -- is what Republican presidential hopeful Jon Huntsman referred to last week as a ""lost decade of growth.""</br></br>In other words, the issue isn't just the recession that began in December 2007, or President Barack Obama's obvious difficulty in pulling the nation out of it. It's the fact that the American economy hasn't been a robust producer of growth and jobs for a long time, beginning well before the recession.</br></br>Americans sense this, which is why polls show they fear for their future and that of their kids. The party that creates some confidence that it can fix this underlying growth problem is the one that will have the real advantage."
"NEW YORK -- Small investors, worried about a recession but afraid of missing out on the stock market's gains, are turning to a conservative old standby: high-yielding stock mutual funds.</br></br>These ""may not be high-flyers, but they get you back into the equity market without a lot of risk,"" says Lawrence Kantor, executive vice president at Lexington Management Co. in Saddle Brook, N.J.</br></br>Minimizing risk has a high priority for individual investors since the October 1987 market crash, which left many with a distaste for stocks. Millions poured cash into safer money-market funds, where yields sometimes exceed 10%, or Treasury bills, which now yield 8 1/2% or more.</br></br>But recently money managers have noticed an increasing appetite among small investors for stock funds managed with a conservative strategy, especially those that invest in old-line, blue-chip companies that pay hefty dividends. The appeal of such funds suggests that small investors want to play the stock market -- but want a cushion in case a recession develops.</br></br>T. Rowe Price Associates' Equity Income Fund, the firm's most conservative stock fund, expanded its assets 70% this year to $850 million from $500 million. Its total return, price gains plus dividends, advanced 22% in the 12 months through May 4; it has risen 8.5% so far this year."
"Over the past three months investors would have been better off putting their cash in a money market fund or municipal bonds than investing in the average Washington area stock.</br></br>Though conventional wisdom contends that the longest bull market in U.S. history is still thundering ahead, ""ambling"" would be a more descriptive verb when it came to the second-quarter performance of stocks of companies based in the District, Maryland and Virginia.</br></br>The share price of the average regional company gained just 1.1 percent in the past quarter as measured by the Washington Post-Bloomberg Regional Stock Index. That was the poorest quarterly performance in a year, a dramatic slowdown from the average stock's 12 percent run-up in the first three months of the year.</br></br>With money market accounts and tax-exempt bonds yielding an average 5 percent to 6 percent annually, local investors who parked their money came out ahead of those who ran with the bulls.</br></br>Amid the plodding performance of regional stocks as a group, however, a handful of highflying Maryland and Virginia technology stocks were among the top performers on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market.

"A consensus is forming to set the increase in the capital of the World Bank at ""the upper end"" of the $40 billion-$80 billion range being discussed, bank president Barber B. Conable Jr.said yesterday as a three-day joint meeting of the bank and International Monetary Fund neared its end.</br></br>Conable, speaking to reporters at a press breakfast, said financial leaders favor a large increase in funding for the international agency because ""most countries don't want us to come back"" for more money too soon.</br></br>Bank officials have been seeking an increase in capital for two years. A major obstacle was cleared last month when Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III announced that the United States would support an increase, which Congress would have to approve.</br></br>Baker has never specified how much he believes the bank's capital should be raised, and the sum is now subject to intense negotiation among bank member countries.</br></br>Also in question is the proportion of capital that member countries would put up in cash, rather than simply pledging to provide if needed."
"JAKARTA, Indonesia -- The International Monetary Fund's revised pact with Indonesia to restart lending of $43 billion in assistance will allow Jakarta greater social spending and a budget deficit of 8.5% of gross domestic product for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1999.</br></br>This deficit will be wholly financed by foreign borrowings and will, subsequently, require additional funds of at least $4 billion from outside sources, the IMF's top man in Jakarta, Hubert Neiss, said.</br></br>But he stressed that these funds were urgently required to head off an economic ""emergency"" in the world's fourth-most-populous nation. ""Production and exports have been disrupted, unemployment is increasing, the banks are paralyzed, and food prices are rising,"" Mr. Neiss said. ""It's no wonder the rupiah rate has depreciated.""</br></br>Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers hailed the new pact between Jakarta and suggested the U.S. will help Indonesia get the money it needs both from international financial institutions and other countries; he wasn't specific. The success of the IMF program, he added, depends on Indonesia's ""ability to sustain both economic and political reforms."" Financial analysts voiced surprise at the economic assumptions under which the IMF and Indonesia calculated this latest pact. The rupiah is targeted to end the year at 10,000 against the U.S. dollar, substantially stronger than its Thursday close of 14,700. However, many currency analysts fear that the rupiah could weaken in the months ahead, given social and political concerns.</br></br>All of this raises the possibility that Indonesia's budget deficit could actually exceed the target of 8.5% of GDP. The government will probably have only two options to cover a bigger deficit, analysts say: the seeking of even more international assistance or the restructuring of sovereign debt. Either way, one Jakarta-based diplomat said: ""It looks like we [the international community] will be asked to cough up again."""
"CHICAGO -- Bank One Corp., whose credit-card business has been hurt by rising interest rates, warned investors that first-quarter profit would likely fall shy of analysts' projections.</br></br>A First Call/Thomson Financial poll of 14 analysts showed a median estimate of 65 cents a diluted share, with a range of 62 cents to 69 cents. ""We would expect and encourage the consensus to settle at the 60-cent level,"" said Bank One's president and acting chief executive, Verne Istock.</br></br>With about 1.1 billion diluted shares outstanding, 60 cents would equal about $660 million of net income for the quarter ending March 31. A year ago, the banking concern posted net of $1.15 billion, or 88 cents a share.</br></br>The disclosure sent Bank One shares down $1.1875, or 4.5%, to $25 each in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at 4 p.m. Friday.</br></br>Mr. Istock said the first quarter would be the year's weakest. Rates that banks pay for deposits and other funds they lend have risen in recent months. But in the hotly competitive credit-card market, it is difficult to raise loan rates because many borrowers can easily jump to lower-rate cards offered through directmail solicitations."
"The persistent shortage of workers that has been crimping growth plans at many companies won't be ending anytime soon, according to Manpower Inc.'s latest survey of U.S. employers' hiring plans.</br></br>Demand for employees is still growing, and with unemployment at its current extremely low levels, ""the traditional labor supply is essentially exhausted,"" Manpower said.</br></br>Companies pinched for labor may get a modicum of relief from recent legislative changes that eliminated Social Security earning limits; that freed some older workers from restrictions on their ability to work. But recruiting more workers ""will continue to challenge employers throughout the country,"" Manpower said.</br></br>Of the about 16,000 companies that participated in the survey, about 35% said they expect to be recruiting additional workers in the third quarter.</br></br>That's the highest level seen in the 24 years that the survey has been conducted. During the year-earlier quarter, and again in the second quarter of the current year, the figure was an already very strong 32%."
"Adjustable-rate mortgages are gaining in popularity again now that interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages have increased to between 10 1/2 and 11 percent, housing economists reported this week.</br></br>With starting interest rates as low as 7 1/2 to 8 percent, adjustables are expected to take up a larger share of the market as long as fixed-rate loans continue to be priced above 10 percent.</br></br>""Most people should take a hard look at ARMS in today's interest-rate climate,"" said Thomas A. Lawler, vice president and senior economist for the Federal National Mortgage Association, which buys mortgages from lenders for resale into the secondary market.</br></br>""For many people an ARM is a good deal right now, particularly if you know you are going to be moving again within the next five years,"" Lawler said. ""ARMs are priced low enough below fixed-rate loans to make them very attractive. Their popularity is only going to increase.""</br></br>ARMS, which were introduced by lenders in the early 1980s as an alternative to high-interest fixed-rate mortgages, have waxed and waned in popularity as rates on fixed-rate loans have fluctuated, with adjustables always gaining in popularity when rates on fixed-rate loans increased."

"NEW YORK -- The dollar rebounded from a three-day rally in the yen after the Federal Reserve offered reassuring words on the U.S. economy, which calmed the frayed nerves of yen-funded carry-trade investors.</br></br>The dollar had already started to reverse the three-day yen rally before the Federal Open Market Committee meeting ended, amid market expectations that the FOMC wouldn't make comments that could roil the markets.</br></br>The FOMC didn't disappoint. It left rates on hold at 5.25% for the eighth straight time and continued to say it expects the U.S. economy to see ""moderate"" growth over the next few months.</br></br>That further eased recent worries among carry-trade investors, who borrow yen at low interest rates to buy higher-yielding currencies such as the dollar, that U.S. subprime mortgage sector problems could spill into the broader U.S. or global economies.</br></br>""The fear was that the Fed may be a bit dovish"" on U.S. growth and inflation worries, said Matthew Strauss, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets.

"What, us worry?</br></br>Some investors think the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its policy meeting today; some think it won't. Both camps seem to think that whatever the Fed does, it won't hurt too much.</br></br>In that only-slightly-nervous environment, stocks were virtually flat yesterday, one of the least pronounced moves recently on a day before a Fed policy meeting. The Nasdaq Composite Index, dominated by technology darlings such as Cisco Systems, fell only a hair after setting a string of 11 records in 12 trading days. It inched down 1.61 points to 3219.54.

""We believe that the focus that Novo Nordisk has is a key driver behind the success of the company."""
"It is time for investors to rethink safety.</br></br>Until May 22, when Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress that the central bank might start scaling back its massive bond-buying program this year, investors could find shelter from market drops via bonds or stocks that pay high dividends and are less volatile. But since then, it is these same ""safe"" investments that are being punished the most.</br></br>The beauty of assets traditionally perceived as ""safe"" -- or, more correctly, defensive -- was that, while they didn't gain as much as risky assets in boom periods, they offered investors some protection in times of turmoil.</br></br>This past month's roller-coaster ride has offered a preview of how the next few years might be different.</br></br>Since Mr. Bernanke's May statements, the yields of most kinds of bonds have shot up, sending prices off a cliff.

"WASHINGTON -- Somewhat subdued job growth and declining hourly wages in July offered the clearest signs yet that the economy is throttling down from the second quarter's torrid pace.</br></br>The financial markets exhaled on Friday, quickly concluding that the Labor Department's benign employment report takes the pressure off the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its policy meeting Aug. 20. Stock and bond markets rallied, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging 85.08 points, to 5679.83, while the price of the 30-year Treasury bond jumped 1 1/8 points, pushing down the yield to nearly 6.73%.</br></br>Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress two weeks ago that policy makers were ready to tighten credit to head off inflation unless signs of a slowdown became evident soon. Just in time, that evidence is emerging. The economy added 193,000 jobs in July, much more tame than June's huge gain of 220,000.</br></br>The unemployment rate rose only a tenth of a percentage point to 5.4% of the work force in July, and Fed officials said they're still concerned about labor-market tightness and the prospect that rising wages could drive prices higher. Yet they also said there's scant evidence of this; indeed, the employment report showed average hourly earnings retreated by two cents after shooting up nine cents in June. With inflation stable, the Fed is increasingly likely to stay on the sidelines.</br></br>The report ""did much to allay a lot of those fears about an overheating economy,"" said economist Ken Mayland of KeyCorp in Cleveland. ""It makes a good case that things are simmering down some."""

Will it be strong enough to pull us completely out of the recessionary rut, or so weak that the economy relapses after only a brief revival -- dragging stock prices down, too?</br></br>Relax. Analysts say events are unfolding about as they should. While the stock market may have raced ahead of the economic recovery, good times -- or at least better times -- lie ahead for investors with patience, they reassure.</br></br>Ironically, one sign that the recession is probably beginning to ease is the government's admission two weeks ago that the U.S. economy has been in a downturn since last summer.</br></br>""The government is usually the last to admit that we're in a recession,"" says A.C. Moore, a portfolio manager at Argus Investment Management in Santa Clara, Calif. ""When the government does finally admit it, it's usually a classic buying time for the stock market because we're probably at the bottom and steps are being taken to bring us out."""
"The Federal Reserve recently announced that it will increase or decrease the size of its monthly bond-buying program in response to changing economic conditions. This amounts to a policy of fine-tuning its quantitative-easing program, a puzzling strategy since the evidence suggests that the program has done little to raise economic growth while saddling the Fed with an enormous balance sheet.</br></br>Quantitative easing, or what the Fed prefers to call long-term asset purchases, is supposed to stimulate the economy by increasing share prices, leading to higher household wealth and therefore to increased consumer spending. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has described this as the ""portfolio-balance"" effect of the Fed's purchase of long-term government securities instead of the traditional open-market operations that were restricted to buying and selling short-term government obligations.</br></br>Here's how it is supposed to work. When the Fed buys long-term government bonds and mortgage-backed securities, private investors are no longer able to buy those long-term assets. Investors who want long-term securities therefore have to buy equities. That drives up the price of equities, leading to more consumer spending.</br></br>But despite the Fed's current purchases of $85 billion a month and an accumulation of more than $2 trillion of long-term assets, the economy is limping along with per capita gross domestic product rising at less than 1% a year. Although it is impossible to know what would happen without the central bank's asset purchases, the data imply that very little increase in GDP can be attributed to the so-called portfolio-balance effect of the Fed's actions.</br></br>Even if all of the rise in the value of household equities since quantitative easing began could be attributed to the Fed policy, the implied increase in consumer spending would be quite small. According to the Federal Reserve's Flow of Funds data, the total value of household stocks and mutual funds rose by $3.6 trillion between the end of 2009 and the end of 2012. Since past experience implies that each dollar of increased wealth raises consumer spending by about four cents, the $3.6 trillion rise in the value of equities would raise the level of consumer spending by about $144 billion over three years, equivalent to an annual increase of $48 billion or 0.3% of nominal GDP."
"Federal Reserve officials stepped up efforts to assure markets that a Thursday increase in the discount rate, an interest rate it charges on emergency loans to banks, wasn't a signal that the central bank was trying to tighten credit more broadly.</br></br>Stock-futures and credit markets initially reeled late Thursday when the Fed announced it was boosting the rate to 0.75% from 0.50% Thursday. But the stock market edged up Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 9.45 points to 10402.35, and prices for 10-year Treasury notes climbing, while their yields fell to 3.78%.</br></br>""We made a very small technical change,"" Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley said Friday during a question-and-answer session after a speech in San Juan, Puerto Rico. ""The action yesterday [Thursday] was really an action about the improvement in banks."" These institutions no longer need the emergency source of cheap funding as they did during the depths of the financial crisis, he said.</br></br>The Fed described the Thursday move as a step toward ""further normalization"" in its emergency-lending programs initiated during the worst of the financial crisis. It follows the lapsing of unusual lending programs put in place during the crisis, such as one offering short-term loans to blue-chip companies.</br></br>Officials chose to announce the discount-rate increase between scheduled meetings of its policy committee in part to underscore the clear separation between this move and the move--still in the future--to lift more economically significant rates, according to Fed insiders."
"Plain-vanilla bonds aren't enough these days.</br></br>In an era of painfully low interest rates, financial pros are advising income-hungry investors to include diverse assets such as dividend-paying stocks, emerging-markets stocks, real-estate investment trusts and high-yield corporate bonds in their conservative portfolios.</br></br>Some advisers see these areas as havens compared with broad stock-market indexes. However, these assets have become riskier now that yield-seeking investors have been moving into them and have bid up prices.</br></br>Moreover, investments that seem above the fray can fall hard. There have been periods in the past when some of them tanked; the average real-estate mutual fund, for example, shed 48% between September and November 2008 -- the category's worst three-month loss of the past 20 years.</br></br>Here's a look at why investment pros are recommending these four areas to conservative investors -- but also what could go wrong."
"Transparency is a hallmark of modern capitalism, and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has made transparency a hallmark of his new regime. Yet among our leading financial institutions, opacity, not financial transparency, has been on the rise.</br></br>The combination -- increasingly opaque financial markets and increasingly transparent monetary policy -- has created a dangerous brew of financial excesses. Unless both trends are reversed, financial stability will remain elusive.</br></br>The explanation for increasingly opaque financial markets lies chiefly in securitization -- the conversion of non-marketable assets into marketable obligations -- which has accelerated dramatically in recent decades.</br></br>In theory, securitized markets are supposed to operate on the basis of accurate and readily available prices, the clear assessment of credit quality, and objective analyses of these obligations by rating agencies and those engaged in trading and underwriting them. These virtuous mechanisms presumably have been reinforced by a host of new credit instruments, especially financial derivatives that mitigate risk taking. Securitization also has been supported by a dazzling array of new quantitative analytical techniques that are capable, according to practitioners, of defining risk probability down to decimal point levels.</br></br>So what went wrong? In the broadest sense, the structural changes in the financial markets encouraged participants to become short-term oriented."

"Federal Reserve policymakers, concerned about jittery financial markets, an unstable dollar, new inflationary pressures and conflicting evidence on the strength of the economy, will meet today to set a monetary course for coming weeks.</br></br>Some financial analysts expect the Fed to move soon to increase its 5*/2 percent discount rate‰ÛÓthe interest rate it charges on loans to financial institutions‰ÛÓto show its determination to control inflation and to help prop up the dollar. How- ever, other analysts believe Fed officials will be too wary about hurting economic growth to raise the key rate unless another drop in the dollar forces their hand.</br></br>In a series of interviews earlier this month, several members of the policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, indicated that they saw no need to make any major changes in policy.</br></br>Since FOMC‰Ûªs last meeting in March, some longer-term interest rates have risen more than l‰Û÷/i percentage points. Over the period the dollar fell sharply, sparking worries</br></br>among financial market participants of a surge in inflation and a tightening of monetary policy in response by the Fed. Yesterday the bond market initially fell, as it had on Friday, but rallied before the day was out. Analysts said the gain may have been due to a small rise in the value of the dollar and a decline in a closely watched commodity price index, which had been going up rapidly in recent weeks."

"WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials are taking pains to assure the public that if its key interest rate keeps dropping all the way to zero, there will still be plenty of ways to boost the economy.</br></br>Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has said the central bank can buy bonds, thereby driving down long-term interest rates. Yesterday, Fed Governor Ben Bernanke said if that didn't work, the Fed could lend directly to banks or help finance a tax cut.</br></br>Two weeks ago, the Fed cut its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on one-day loans between banks, to a 41-year low of 1.25%, from 1.75%. The move fueled talk that the central bank might be running out of ammunition in its fight to keep the economy growing, and spurred a related fear that inflation might give way to deflation, or generally declining prices. Since interest rates can't go below zero, deflation would cause the real, or price-adjusted, cost of borrowing to rise.</br></br>Mr. Bernanke said yesterday that with the funds rate at zero, the Fed would lose ""its traditional means"" of stimulating spending, but it ""has most definitely not run out of ammunition.""</br></br>It isn't assured that the steps Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Greenspan outlined would be effective if the U.S. were in a deep recession marked by deflation and the unwillingness of businesses and consumers to borrow at any interest rate."

"As part of their general pre-election cave in, Congressional Republicans are greasing the skids for $18 billion in fresh money for the International Monetary Fund. Having set themselves up in 1995, the Congressional leadership wakes up at night shaking with fear that President Clinton will veto a bill to keep the government open, then blame them for closing the government.</br></br>With Asian economies toppling and the U.S. financial boom topping out, Republicans are particularly worried about getting tagged for an economic crisis unless they give Mr. Clinton anything he asks. The President lectured them again when speaking at the IMF meeting this week: They should pay the $18 billion because ""there is no excuse for refusing to supply the fire department with water while the fire is burning.""</br></br>Before you pour liquid on a raging fire, we might suggest, make sure it doesn't smell like gasoline. On the record of the past 15 months of crisis, the IMF doesn't look like much of a fireman. More of an arsonist. Back in March 1997, IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus gave a speech predicting for Asia at worst a ""cyclical correction that is not expected to be deep or prolonged."" Mr. Camdessus was at that point already urging Thailand to devalue -- apparently clueless about the trouble that would come of it. The IMF went on to urge the devaluations that dragged down South Korea, wrecked Indonesia and set off shock waves that -- amplified by Russia -- now threaten Brazil.</br></br>To combat this, the IMF began by pouring $18 billion into Thailand, and said the worst was over. Then the Fund led a $43 billion bailout for Indonesia and said all would be well. There followed $57 billion for South Korea, $23 billion for Russia. That comes to $141 billion. The fund is now arranging a similar $30 billion experience for Brazil, bringing recent IMF crisis-dousing to $171 billion. Yet clearly the world is in worse shape than when the Fund back in 1994 hopped on its fire engine to put out Mexico.</br></br>Why is Congress buying in to this? Three reasons."
"Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>The backlog of initiaI public offerings waiting to be priced is smaller than a year ago, an indicator of a worsening environment for bringing companies public.</br></br>About 114 companies are waiting to go public, based on filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, down from 160 at the same time last year, according to data tracker Dealogic. The deals are estimated to be worth $20.9 billion, down from a waiting list worth $29.1 billion a year ago. Last week, just seven companies filed IPO paperwork with the SEC.</br></br>Much of the slowdown has to do with the broader stock market, which has been in the red almost the entire time this year. Some is because companies need more time to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires detailed summaries of internal controls and auditor opinions on those controls.</br></br>And some is due to the rotten performance that some recent IPOs have put in, such as metal-products distributor Earle M. Jorgensen Co., which hasn't revisited its offering price of $10 a share since the moment it began trading."
"The Commerce Department reported yesterday that consumer spending in July rose by $59.7 billion, or 0.8 percent, compared with $44.5 billion, or 0.6 percent, in June, the largest increase in four months. The department's Bureau of Economic Analysis also said personal disposable income increased $120.3 billion, or 1.5 percent, up from a $30.6 billion, or 0.4 percent, increase one month earlier.</br></br>Consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of the nation's economy, and economists viewed yesterday's news as more support for recent reports that suggest the once-sluggish pace of the economy is picking up.</br></br>""Consumers are really the locomotive pulling the rest of the country forward, and the fuel for that locomotive at this moment is the tax cut and the fuel derived from mortgage refinancing,"" said Sung Won Sohn, chief economic officer for Wells Fargo & Co. in Minneapolis.</br></br>Economists attributed the increase in consumer spending in large part to the third tax cut by President Bush and Congress since 2001, but they also cited spending on new cars spurred by generous rebates, as well as continued mortgage refinancing because of low interest rates.</br></br>But Richard Berner, chief U.S. economist for Morgan Stanley in New York, warned against giving too much weight to the idea that consumer spending has been driven by cash generated by mortgage refinancings driven by low interest rates. ""There's no mistaking the fact that lower mortgage payments have helped some consumers,"" he said, ""but not all consumers have refinanced their mortgages, and not all consumers have mortgages."
"'I know you believe you understand what you think I said, but I am not sure you realize that what you heard is not what I meant.""</br></br>That quote did not originate with Alan Greenspan, but it is widely attributed to him, perhaps because it so neatly (""eloquently"" is not quite the right word) sums up his knack for obfuscation, especially before Congress. By now, new Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke probably wishes he'd had that sentence printed on a business card when CNBC anchor Maria Bartiromo asked him at a dinner over the weekend whether he thought markets had properly understood him last week.</br></br>The Chairman's testimony last Thursday prompted a mild stock rally on the hopes that the Fed believes it can soon afford to halt its string of interest-rate hikes. Investors always like to believe the end of rate hikes is nigh, because rising rates create greater financial risks. But stocks went in reverse on mid-afternoon Monday when Ms. Bartiromo reported that Mr. Bernanke had told her over the weekend that his testimony had been misinterpreted. To be fair to the new Fed chief, there may be no other job in the world where a handful of words uttered at a dinner party can count for so much.</br></br>However, the real issue is less Mr. Bernanke's dinner-party discretion, or Ms. Bartiromo's, than the Fed's policy intentions. And one reason for market disquiet is uncertainty about how seriously the Fed is taking the risk of incipient inflation. Any new Fed chief has first and foremost to establish his credibility in maintaining the soundness of the currency, and the last few days suggest Mr. Bernanke has some work to do in that department.</br></br>In the wake of his ""dovish"" remarks last week, the dollar continued its fall to a new recent low -- even against the Canadian dollar. Gold and commodity prices kept rising, and oil staged another charge above $70 a barrel. Even the TIPS spread on inflation-linked bonds widened. In other words, inflationary expectations staged a rally of their own."
"CONSUMER SPENDING jumped 0.9% for the second straight month in July, more than double the modest 0.4% rise in personal income. The pattern continued to defy economists' predictions of slower spending. Some analysts cautioned that the higher spending bodes ill for the nation's massive trade deficit.</br></br>Oil prices dipped near $18 a barrel and ended at a four-month low on reports of OPEC overproduction. Meanwhile, several big U.S. oil companies lowered the price they pay for the leading grade of domestic crude.</br></br>U.S. oil and gas drilling has risen from last year's depressed level despite lower petroleum prices.</br></br>---</br></br>The dollar closed mixed after Japan reportedly moved to boost the currency but failed to follow through later in the day.

"NEW YORK -- Treasurys ended mixed as the market largely ignored signs of continued strength in manufacturing and instead looked ahead to tomorrow's monthly update on labor-market growth.</br></br>The 30-year Treasury bond fell 9/32 point, or $2.8125 for a bond with $1,000 face value, to 101 6/32. Its yield rose to 6.153% from 6.133% late Tuesday, as bond yields move inversely to prices. But shorter maturities ended higher. Prices of 10-year notes gained 6/32, for example.</br></br>The divergence stemmed from sales of 30-year bonds and purchases of other maturities -- so-called curve trades -- driven by wagers on how the market will be affected by the Treasury Department's planned buybacks of debt securities.</br></br>Dealers decided it was ""the trade of the day,"" said Vinnie Verterano, director of government trading at Nomura Securities in New York.</br></br>Among economic reports during the session, the National Association of Purchasing Management's February business index -- a broad gauge of manufacturing-sector activity -- rose to 56.9 in February from 56.3 in January. A figure above 50 suggests an expansion of activity. An index in the NAPM report that tracks prices paid by manufacturers jumped to 74.1 from 72.6, indicating a substantial rise in price pressures during the month."
"You've just been given $200 million to invest, but with a catch. You can buy only Internet stocks. And you're expected to deliver big returns, while avoiding risks.</br></br>That's the opportunity -- and challenge -- facing mutual-fund manager Matthew Ervin, who finds himself on a recent day trying to pursuade his boss that he has found Net stocks that fit these seemingly contradictory criteria.</br></br>With feigned patience, he paces a sunlit conference room, explaining the history of computing: Computers have gotten progressively faster, but until recently, everything was slowed by the lack of bandwidth. Now that the pipes have opened up, a new era has dawned, and companies seizing that change would be great investments for his soon-to-be launched mutual fund, even at today's sky-high prices.</br></br>Morty Schaja, president of Baron Capital Group, disagrees with his fund manager. ""I'm uncomfortable with the business,"" he says. ""But if the valuation was 10 or 20 times less than it is now, I might be interested.""</br></br>Too risky, too expensive. And so it goes as Mr. Ervin, 30 years old, and his co-manager, Mitchell Rubin, 34, try to identify stocks for one of the latest entries in the Internet-fund sweepstakes: Baron iOpportunity. At this point, late in the afternoon of Feb. 29, just 18 hours before the fund goes live, the managers have approvals to buy just 15 stocks, unless prices drop significantly. Yet they have a lot of cash to put to work -- $199,626,449.63 to be precise. That's the amount Baron, a highly respected boutique-fund family, has raised for the new portfolio."
"FRANKFURT -- The Federal Reserve's hefty interest-rate cut adds to the mounting pressure on the European Central Bank to follow suit today to boost the flagging euro-zone economy, but stubbornly high inflation and national politics are putting the world's No. 2 central bank in a bind.</br></br>Inflation isn't falling significantly despite the slowdown, and remains above the ECB's target of 2%. In addition, inflation rates among the 12 nations in the euro zone are diverging. This makes a one-size-fits-all monetary policy more difficult to practice and pits the interests of small, higher-inflation countries against those of the large nations that would likely benefit from lower rates.</br></br>At today's meeting, the ECB will weigh whether the bad news on the economy warrants a shift in focus from fighting inflation to supporting growth, a move that could by extension aid the U.S. and global economy. Over the past month, further evidence of a halting recovery has continued to pour in. Just yesterday, Germany reported that orders to its manufacturing industry fell a monthly 2.5% in September, dimming the prospects of Europe's largest economy. And in France, the region's second-largest powerhouse, industrial demand fell in the third quarter of this year, and a survey showed that business executives expect a further drop in the fourth. The Fed's decision also underscores the weakness of the U.S. economy, which Europe traditionally counts on to pull it out of a slump.</br></br>Already this year, the ECB did an about-face on its attitude toward inflation. During the summer, the bank was gearing up to raise borrowing costs but had to quickly retract that plan as the recovery and stock markets faltered. Still, during the past few days, public statements from ECB officials suggested the 18-member governing council hadn't yet reached an agreement to cut rates as early as today. The ECB has surprised markets before, however.</br></br>Some economists believe that if the ECB holds rates steady today, it will simply postpone the inevitable, miss a chance to appear proactive, and come under fire from the politicians, banks and media. ""What do they win or lose by waiting another four weeks?"" said Julian von Landesberger, an economist with HVB Group in Munich. ""Until now the ECB was much too optimistic with regard to growth next year."""
"If you're starting to sniff recession in the air, remember that this editorial is the third in a series.</br></br>It seems time, since over the past two weeks the markets have been giving off the symptoms of a stall. The stock market sidestepped into the new year and promptly fell about 250 points as of Friday's close. Markets reacted coldly last Tuesday to a 40-year bond offering by the government's S&L bailout agency. Gold began the year at about $400 and in three weeks is up to $420. Simultaneously, the White House has turned a bit cranky over the Fed's handling of monetary policy.</br></br>Most economists still expect merely a slowdown in growth, but the sense that something's wrong is palpable. What we've witnessed is entirely consistent with what we predicted in our two ""Mitchell Recession"" editorials in November. The market, and through it the general economy, is being whipsawed by Congress's handling of the capital-gains issue. We first noted back on November 7 that Senator Mitchell was congratulating himself for killing the Bush capital-gains proposal, and wondered whether he'd take credit later if the economy stalled. On November 30, with the market at 2688 we wrote:</br></br>""The stock market, after rising while a capital-gains cut gained political momentum, collapsed 190 points when Mr. Mitchell stopped it, and now remains at about the August 1 level. Everyone is therefore looking for the Fed to ease monetary policy.""</br></br>The market rallied a bit in December; tax advisers suggested that normal year-end profit-taking be pushed into 1990, because their consensus among people who mattered -- George Bush, Lloyd Bentsen, Dan Rostenkowski was that a capital-gains cut in 1990 was baked in the cake."
"AuthorAffiliation Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</br></br>The company's niche is paging equipment, and the infrastructure needed to support it. Back in 1993, ""competitors were starting to consider paging out of date, and thought it might become obsolete as newer wireless technologies emerged,"" says Lior Bregman, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. But things turned out different. ""While everyone else was ignoring paging's potential, the industry continued to grow 20% to 30% annually,"" Mr. Bregman says.</br></br>The company's single-minded focus has paid off in a fat market share. In the U.S. market for paging switches and transmitters, it has about 80% and 65% shares, respectively. Motorola Inc. is in second place.</br></br>As Glenayre moved into paging, the company shed all its businesses outside the telecommunications industry. The strategic shift paid off immediately, boosting Glenayre's sales to $136.1 million in 1993 from just $15.6 million the prior year.</br></br>As pagers have gotten cheaper and more advanced, they have become more mainstream -- appearing on the belts of money managers and in the backpacks of teenagers, as opposed to just doctors' lapels and drug dealers' pockets. And the paging market has taken off internationally as well, with new countries and overseas operators continually being added to Glenayre's customer list."
"The stock market suffered new losses yesterday after a day of nervous gyrations, but the major damage was in the bond market, where a sharp sell-off occurred as Treasury bond interest rates rose to almost 9.5 percent-their highest level since early last year.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average, the stock market's key indicator, closed at 2602.04, down 8.93 points. The Dow, which spent most of the day on the minus side, was off as much as 29 points at 2 p.m. but recovered somewhat by the close of trading.</br></br>The bond market was the focal point of yesterday's action as the price of the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond fell $17.50 for every $1,000 of face value, raising yields to almost 9.5 percent. The bond's price dropped $11.50 per $1,000 on Tuesday. Bond prices and interest rates move in opposite directions in order to adjust the yield of older bonds to make them competitive with newer bonds.</br></br>Market analysts said the fall in bond prices was based on continued weakness of the dollar in global currency markets and signs of growing strength in the nation's economy. The bond market interprets both events as the forerunners of tighter money policies, higher interest rates and losses in the value of bonds.</br></br>In the currency markets, the dollar fell below 141 yen and below 1.8 West German marks. Analysts said a weak dollar raises fears among investors that the Federal Reserve will have to boost interest rates to bolster the currency."
"Sales of previously owned homes jumped a robust 4.6% in May as the housing recovery continued to regain steam amid continued low interest rates and strengthening job growth.</br></br>Existing-home sales rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3,610,000 from a revised pace of 3,450,000 in April, according to the National Association of Realtors. All regions posted gains from April.</br></br>The sales increase was the biggest since December, and marked the second consecutive month of gains after three straight months of declines that housing analysts blamed largely on bad weather in many parts of the country. Indeed, analysts attribute a part of the current resurgence to better weather. But they also credit interest rates that have remained below 8%, as well as improvements in job growth.</br></br>""When you combine low interest rates with stronger job growth, that's a perfect environment for the housing market,"" said Mark M. Zandi, chief economist for Regional Financial Associates, Inc., a consulting firm based in West Chester, Pa. Mr. Zandi added that consumer confidence remains shaky, however, amid uncertainty over the economy and the tax implications of President Clinton's economic plan.</br></br>For now, at least, all indications point to healthy sales through the summer. Though the economy is growing, it is doing so at such a slow pace that inflation no longer seems an immediate threat. That helps keep interest rates down. The 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage fell Friday to a 21-year low of 7.37% from 7.43% the week earlier, according to HSH Associates, Inc., a Butler, N.J. mortgage publishing firm."
"Automobile makers raised prices and reduced dealer incentives on 2004 car models in October while California, the nation's biggest auto market, increased car taxes -- moves that prompted consumers to cut back on purchases.</br></br>That was the upshot of a slew of government data released Friday. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that producer prices rose a larger-than-expected 0.8% on a seasonally adjusted basis in October from the month before, largely because of higher auto prices. Meanwhile, the U.S. Census Bureau reported retail sales slipped 0.3% in October, largely due to declining auto sales.</br></br>""Manufacturers are adjusting incentives in part to see how well their products can do without incentives as the economy strengthens,"" said Robert Schnorbus, chief economist at J.D. Power & Associates, a market research company. ""Consumers, being finicky as they are, just don't like to see incentives go down, and they're pulling back.""</br></br>The Federal Reserve also reported that industrial production rose for the fourth straight month in October, but the pace of increases was curtailed by a slowdown in motor vehicle assemblies.</br></br>Some auto makers responded by fattening incentives in November. This is leading some economists to predict the October sales slowdown and the spike in prices will be temporary. ""It is the pregnant pause of a wiser consumer,"" said David Littman, chief economist of Comerica Bank in Detroit.

"The U.S. and West Germany, recently feuding over monetary policy, agreed during a surprise high-level meeting to support unspecified changes in the seven-nation Louvre accord on exchange-rate and economic-policy cooperation.</br></br>Yesterday's agreement, which officials confirmed but wouldn't describe, emerged from talks in Frankfurt between Treasury Secretary James Baker and top West German officials, whom Mr. Baker has criticized recently for raising interest rates. Separately, West Germany's central bank acted yesterday to keep short-term interest rates from rising further.</br></br>In a statement after the meeting, the two countries pledged to continue February's Louvre accord, which set agreed exchange-rate levels and cooperative economic policies. But the statement noted that the pact is ""flexible,"" and the officials are said to have agreed it should be altered to accommodate different exchange rates for the dollar and mark and different understandings on monetary policy. A similar alteration was made in the pact in April after talks between the U.S. and Japan. The U.S. and West Germany yesterday said they were consulting their partners in the so-called Group of Seven about the meeting.</br></br>For several days, the Treasury chief has publicly blasted Bonn for raising interest rates after pledging to stimulate economic growth. He has threatened that the U.S. might favor lowering the officially supported dollar exchange rate against the mark unless West Germany eased monetary policy. And he has said the U.S. would refuse to follow West Germany in raising rates.</br></br>This threat alone had already caused the dollar to fall against the mark, and the U.S.-West German dispute raised fears of a breakup of the Louvre accord itself, adding to turmoil in the financial markets. In the face of yesterday's massive stock market drop, the dollar -- which fell earlier in the day in overseas trading -- rallied in late New York trading against the mark in response to news of Mr. Baker's understanding with West German officials."

He said that since data were collected for the April wholesale price index, food prices have ‰ÛÏstabilized.‰Û</br></br>Wholesale prices are prices businesses charge other businesses, but changes in wholesale prices are often a precursor of eventual changes in the prices consumers pay.</br></br>Even though wholesale price increases are adjusted to account for regular seasonal variations, food prices lend to jump around more readily in response to temporary factors than industrial prices. As a result, economists look more carefully,at industrial prices because they have a longer-lasting impact on the overall price level.</br></br>Nevertheless, the 0.8 per cent wholesale price rise last month, which works out to an annual increase of 10 per cent, stands in contrast to the prior five months, when wholesale prices rose little or, as in January and February, fell."

The bill would apply to stocks, homes and equipment.</br></br>At the same time, the committee refused, on a vote of 24 to 11, to approve a proposal to provide relief to taxpayers for the new Social Security tax increases that went into effect in January. The proposal would have allowed taxpayers a credit on income tax to offset the new taxes.</br></br>The surprise approval of the capital gains measure took committee leaders aback. Immediately after the vote, Hep. A1 Ullman (D-Ore.), the chairman, tried to adjourn the session, but was voted down. Later, liberals banded together to block any reconsideration of the vote."
"Russia might seem a dubious candidate for an international financial bailout, given its chronic failure to stabilize its economy despite repeated dollops of foreign aid.</br></br>Yet compared with an economic collapse in, say, Indonesia or South Korea, the prospect of a meltdown in Russia is far more frightening to U.S. officials and international economic policymakers.</br></br>Therein lies the dilemma confronting the Clinton administration and the International Monetary Fund as Russia undergoes one of the most serious bouts of financial turmoil in its recent history. The Russian stock market fell 15.1 percent last week, and is now worth about half what it was at the start of the year. The crisis has aroused alarm that Russia could default on its $145 billion debt to foreigners unless it receives billions of dollars in fresh loans.</br></br>To critics of Russia's policies, providing such assistance looks like a classic example of throwing good money after bad. But the alternative may be a plunge in the value of the ruble that would devastate the nation's economy, kill public support for the reform program of President Boris Yeltsin and risk social chaos in the world's second-largest nuclear power. As a result, few analysts doubt that the international community will come to Russia's rescue again if the crisis intensifies.</br></br>The odds are high that Russia will end up back in financial trouble even if it gets new loans, but ""nobody's going to let Russia go down the tubes,"" said Clifford Gaddy, an expert in the Russian economy at the Brookings Institution. ""It's always going to be bailed out somehow. The Russians have 30,000 nuclear weapons, and that's 30,000 reasons why they won't be allowed to go under."""

The report, attributed to ""people familiar with the matter,"" said that Summers has not involved Volcker, who is widely regarded as a giant in the world of economic policy, in shaping decisions. Summers was quoted in the Bloomberg report as disputing that characterization, and praising Volcker.</br></br>A source outside the administration who is in contact with key policymakers said yesterday that Volcker, who during the campaign spoke frequently with Obama, has been frustrated that Summers and other White House staff have not engaged him more extensively."

They are nearly identical.</br></br>In one factory, the workers have been trained in computer programming and have the authority to control the computerized machine tools.</br></br>But in the other plant the computerized machine tools are locked up so that only managers can change the programming.

"A quirky mix of assets and markets world-wide has benefited from the simultaneous plunge of crude oil and the U.S. dollar, and strategists are pushing advice that hinges on the continuation of those trends.</br></br>No surprise, other commodities besides oil have rallied on the dollar's woes, as have overseas investments, especially companies that produce or sell natural resources. The Dow Jones Japan Financial Index and Dow Jones World Basic Materials Index each gained more than 9% last week. Since November, the Baltic Dry Index, a gauge of shipping costs closely linked to raw-material prices, has jumped nearly 25% to 6134. Gold futures are up 6.6% over the same period to $457.80 on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.</br></br>But stock sectors usually associated with more-aggressive investment strategies, such as technology, have also benefited: The Dow Jones World Technology Index gained almost 8% last week. And the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 2.2%, up 8.8% since November, to 2147.96.</br></br>The upshot, many analysts say, is that investors are betting not just on a continuation of world economic recovery and U.S. dollar weakness, but they are also doing so in especially hard-charging fashion. ""This is the theme right now, big time,"" says James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist, Wells Capital Management. ""People want to be in whatever the most aggressive thing is and get away from the least aggressive.""</br></br>Mr. Paulsen says he believes there is good reason to expect a global recovery, although a weak U.S. jobs report Friday showed that there may yet be a few potholes along the way. The Labor Department said nonfarm payrolls grew by only 112,000 jobs in November, well below the 200,000 jobs economists had expected before the data release."
"Maryland House Speaker Michael E. Busch had a single question for a delegate who recently compared his crusade against slot machine gambling to the ancient tale of Horatius, the man credited with preventing the Etruscan army from conquering and pillaging Rome.</br></br>Legend has it that Horatius single-handedly staved off attackers by defending a strategic bridge until it could be destroyed, then jumped into the Tiber River. But versions differ as to whether he reached safety and was duly rewarded by a grateful city or drowned before reaching the bank.</br></br>In the modern world of state politics, Busch (D-Anne Arundel) is the chief obstacle to a proposal that would dramatically expand legalized gambling in Maryland. The affable new speaker has pitted his House of Delegates against Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. (R), who has made legalizing slot machines a centerpiece of his first year in office, and against Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr., a Democrat and pro-slots veteran with a proven ability to manipulate the levers of power.</br></br>In the coming days, Busch's political acumen will be put to the test. He will bring to the House floor a proposal to study the gambling issue for a year. He will settle on a package of tax increases and budget cuts to fill a gap estimated at more than $400 million. He will have to move those proposals through two key finance committees, where leaders would rather use slot machine revenue to backfill at least a portion of the shortfall. And then he will have to persuade a majority in the House to vote for the budget plan the following week.</br></br>A plan to close corporate tax loopholes could raise about $200 million but would still require deep cuts to balance the budget. Two other options, raising the sales tax by a penny or temporarily increasing the income tax for top earners, would raise more money. But Ehrlich has promised to veto both, meaning delegates might be forced to take a politically difficult vote for naught."

"WASHINGTON -- Consumer prices increased a scant 0.1% last month, as prices for certain consumer goods -- notably clothing -- continued to fall.</br></br>January's meager inflation rate was the same as December's, and over the past year consumer prices have climbed just 1.7%, the Labor Department said Friday. Excluding food and energy prices, considered to be volatile sectors, consumer prices rose a similar 0.1% in January, following a 0.3% increase in December.</br></br>To better understand just how well-behaved inflation is, it helps to look at particular sectors. For example, while prices overall crept up, apparel prices plunged in January by 1.1%, after a 0.6% drop in December. Over the past year, clothing prices fell 1.4% compared to a 0.4% increase the previous year.</br></br>Women's apparel fell 1.9% last month compared to a 0.6% drop in December, while footwear dropped 0.9% following a 0.6% decline.

Some of these investors have poured large sums into bond funds, even though those holdings may take a beating whenever interest rates rise from today's unusually low levels, possibly later this year. Some forecasters, meanwhile, believe that stocks may finish 2010 up as much as 10%.</br></br>So, for investors who want to step back into stocks but are still anxious, here's a modest suggestion: You don't have to take your stock exposure straight up. You can dilute it by buying an allocation fund that spreads its assets across many market sectors, from stocks and bonds to money-market instruments and convertible securities.</br></br>Such funds typically have less dramatic swings than pure stock vehicles. And ""you will never be in a situation where everyone did well except you because you were in the wrong market niche,'' says Ned Notzon, who oversees allocation strategies at T.

The spring quarter was extraordinary, with the gross national product, adjusted for inflation, rising at an unsustainable 9.2 percent annual rate.

From this point forward, the consensus among forecasters calls for fairly steady but modest economic growth through 1984.

As a result, bank regulators have increased their scrutiny of Worthen by requiring it to submit various written plans, policies and procedures to the St. Louis Fed, including its so-far unsuccessful attempt to name a chairman of the company, its debt-service plans, capital levels and its business plan for the remainder of 1987 and 1988.</br></br>Moreover, Worthen must enlist an independent management consultant to review its organization and management structure and report back to the St. Louis Fed. Worthen also must either charge off as losses or collect all loans or parts of loans that it classified as losses by last Sept. 30. The regulators examined the condition of the company as of that date.</br></br>Worthen signed a regulatory agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank last March, and made a brief public announcement of the action at the time. However, it didn't disclose that bank regulators took a dim view of its operations and the ""problem"" status of seven of its bank units, one of which it sold this year."

"THE FARM BELT is cautiously optimistic as spring planting nears.</br></br>With the exception of winter-wheat areas in the southern plains, weather so far is cooperating with U.S. farmers. While it is still early, ""there is no reason to be too concerned about the spring-planted crops,"" says Richard Pottorff, economist with WEFA Group, Bala Cynwyd, Pa. While subsoil moisture levels may remain below normal, he says, a repeat of last year's drought would be ""extremely unlikely.""</br></br>Moreover, many farmers are ""in real good shape right now,"" says Mark Drabenstott of the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, noting that the drought boosted crop prices, allowing many to sell off reserves at a handsome profit.

"The air is thick with hyperbole, invented statistics and insults to the other guy's mother. Congress must be gearing up to debate Nafta. Perhaps before we get in too deep, it would be helpful to tune out the demagoguery and listen to what leveler heads say on the central issue here: free trade.</br></br>The first level head, Ronald Reagan, discusses Nafta nearby (see related article: ""Tear Down the Trade Wall"" -- WSJ Sept. 13, 1993). We'd like to talk about Adam Smith and David Ricardo, the great economists who laid the groundwork for our understanding of the West's spectacular rise to prosperity. Mr. Ricardo was a Jewish stockbroker who married a Quaker, made a fortune in the stock market and retired young to think about economics. Mr. Smith, the author of ""The Wealth of Nations,"" needs no introduction.</br></br>Messrs. Smith and Ricardo first sketched out the idea that 200 years later remains an article of faith among economists. The idea is called comparative advantage. It says: Let us each specialize in the production of what we're good at, and then trade the fruits of our labor.</br></br>Consider Joe Sixpack, who makes his living fixing cars. With the money he earns, he pays other people to grow his food, assemble his refrigerator and program his Gameboy. Nobody would advise Mr. Sixpack to knock off early at the auto shop and grow his own corn. He can enjoy more of everything by fixing more cars, which is his comparative advantage.</br></br>Notice that it doesn't matter at all to Mr. Sixpack that his Gameboy was programmed in Japan and his frijoles were grown by a Mexican. Adam Smith put it this way: ""If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry, employed in a way in which we have some advantage."""
"Author: Deborah Lynn Blumberg</br></br>NEW YORK--Treasurys rallied Monday, recouping some ground after a sharp selloff in the previous week, as recent selling turned government bonds into an enticing bargain for investors.</br></br>Gains also came as the Federal Reserve completed its first purchase of Treasury securities for the week, buying nearly $8 billion in Treasurys. Traders said bond yields had reached levels that looked enticing to buyers after the prior week's sharp move up in yield, sparking purchasing by foreign central banks. Early Monday, the 10-year yield hit a 3.395% high, a level last seen in June, pulling buyers in.</br></br>In afternoon trading, the 10-year was up 9/32 to 3.282%. The two-year added 2/32 to 0.604%</br></br>The five- and seven-year notes were outperforming, up 13/32 to yield 1.900% and up 17/32 to 2.630%, respectively.

"WASHINGTON -- The latest employment report suggests that the labor market improved during the past month but that the economy is still at a virtual standstill.</br></br>""We're still not going anywhere,"" said Robert Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.</br></br>The Labor Department's employment report for July showed a drop in the unemployment rate to 7.7% of the work force from 7.8%. And 198,000 new jobs were created in July after a revised decline of 63,000 in June.</br></br>But 75,000 of the new jobs came from federally funded summer jobs for teenagers. While those jobs may have helped to lower the unemployment rate of teen-agers by 2.6 percentage points, it did hardly anything to help adults, who are the driving force behind consumer spending.</br></br>But there is also a positive spin to the job growth. With such a slow economy, any job-creation is good. Aside from the growth in government positions, the service sector added 110,000 jobs in July, following a meager increase in June. Within services, eating and drinking places added 20,000 jobs last month."
"WASHINGTON -- Of all the problems the economy has, inflation apparently isn't one of them.</br></br>November's consumer price index rose 0.4%, the Labor Department said. While that's higher than October's 0.1% increase, it doesn't challenge the view that inflation is relatively well-behaved.</br></br>A whitefly infestation in California caused produce prices to skyrocket -- lettuce prices leapt 44.5% -- as grocery store food prices rose 0.8% overall. Many economists feel that the food price jump, plus an increase in gasoline prices, overstated the November increase. The index's core rate, which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, climbed just 0.3%.</br></br>The report sparked further calls for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates once more. The consumer price figures are ""certainly not putting up any impediments"" to further easing, said Martin Regalia, chief economist at the National Council of Savings Institutions. On the other hand, he added, the index alone won't be enough to induce a rate drop.</br></br>This year, the overall consumer price index has grown at a 2.9% annual rate, compared with 6.4% last year."
"Now that Zale is no longer on the rocks, is it ready to shine again?</br></br>Part of the answer will be found in the jewelry retailer's year-end earnings release, expected today. Zale's chief executive promises the company will post a profit for the fiscal fourth quarter ended July 31, something it hasn't done in the four years since it emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. (The company earns most of its profits during the Christmas rush in December.)</br></br>And solid earnings would be just the latest sign that the retailer is poised to recapture the market share it started losing a decade ago due to ineffective management and overwhelming debt. Consider that just three years ago, annual sales volume at Zale's stores averaged $737,000. Today, volume averages more than $1 million, with same-store sales up 5.5% for fiscal 1997 compared with the prior year.</br></br>In addition, productivity is up. Since 1994, Dallas-based Zale has renovated two-thirds of its stores, adding 50% more counter space at those locations. Selling, general and administrative expenses now eat only 38% of sales, down from 44% in 1994. Moreover, by 2000, Zale expects to have increased the number of outlets run by its three major jewelry units to 1,350 from 1,068.</br></br>""They continue to be ahead of the plan when it comes to building the business,"" says Lynn Detrick, an analyst at the Houston securities firm Williams MacKay Jordan & Co, who rates the stock a ""buy."""

In other words, cheap sneakers.</br></br>Manufacturers, full-price retailers and some business organizations beg to differ, claiming that off-price retailers are stronger than ever these days. If legislation giving discounters even more clout passes, they say, it will ultimately mean the end of traditional retailers that provide service, selection and quality guarantees to consumers."

The latest version of the House banking bill also drops the administration's proposals to broaden bank entry into the securities business.</br></br>Last night, the House began its second attempt to pass a banking bill after failing last week, in part because of disagreement over how to allow banks into the securities business.

"Top of the Rock</br></br>By Warren Littlefield</br></br>Doubleday, 326 pages, $27.95</br></br>If history is written by the victors, then the executives presiding over NBC's dismal prime-time performance in recent years are unlikely ever to publish a chronicle of television in the era of ""American Idol,"" ""NCIS"" and other hits the network doesn't air. But there was a time when NBC ruled the ratings, and Warren Littlefield -- the former president of NBC Entertainment who oversaw ""Seinfeld,"" ""Friends,"" ""ER"" and a raft of other moneymaking shows -- doesn't want anyone to forget it. He also surely knows that in the television arts and sciences, people who also write books, or at least have their name on the cover, are practically authors.</br></br>Mr. Littlefield's entry in the shelf-esteem sweepstakes, ""Top of the Rock,"" is an oral history of mostly 1990s television, with interview snippets from on- and off-screen talent and fellow executives. Mr. Littlefield is just one among many speakers, but he gets the biggest entries and wrote the swaggering, cigar-chomping introduction. The book proceeds more or less chronologically, from ""Cheers,"" which ended in the early 1990s, to the launch of ""Will & Grace"" in the late '90s. With plenty of lessons about branding and managing up (the book is about television, after all), Littlefield & Co. give their versions of events, applying the golden rule of television -- essentially, you've got to spin it to win it -- but also settling scores along the way."
"The Iowa caucuses presented the full range of views of the Republican hopefuls. When it came to fiscal strategy, however, there was almost no daylight among them. Each candidate decried the rise of government spending and wants to cut taxes.</br></br>Again and again they noted that spending under President Obama rose to 25% of the economy in 2009, the highest in decades and well over the 20%-21% norm of the last 30 years.</br></br>To hear the GOP candidates tell it, this fact explains the deficit, explains America's long-run fiscal problem, and explains why new taxes cannot be tolerated. Congressional Republicans have the same outlook. The deficit is up thanks to government spending, so we must cut spending right now in every form.</br></br>Yet the long-run fiscal problem facing the country--which is real--has almost nothing to do with the reasons that the deficit is currently large or that spending is abnormally high. They are high for the same reason taxes are abnormally low: because of the economic downturn. We should debate the real issues, not try to pretend the recession never happened.</br></br>The Congressional Budget Office forecast a $1.2 trillion deficit before the Obama administration even came into office. The stimulus added only around $250 billion a year, and more than one-third of that came from tax cuts, especially the tax credit in the stimulus bill's ""Making Work Pay"" provision."

"Ending a turf battle that has lasted nearly two decades, financial market regulators yesterday reached an agreement that clears the way for investors to buy futures contracts based on single stocks.</br></br>The agreement still faces scrutiny from Congress. But lawmakers have told the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission that if they could settle their dispute, Congress would likely adopt their approach. The deal, in which the two have essentially agreed to share regulatory oversight, paves the way to end an 18-year ban on single-stock futures.</br></br>A futures contract is a promise to deliver or to buy at a set date in the future and at a set price a certain item--pounds of coffee, barrels of oil, or, in this case, stocks or bonds. By law, a futures contract must be traded on an exchange.</br></br>Once the ban on single-stock futures is lifted, investors could, for example, sell a futures contract based on shares of International Business Machines Corp. to hedge against a decline in the price of the company's stock, or buy such a contract instead of buying the actual IBM shares.</br></br>Single-stock futures could lower investors' risk by allowing them to hedge against price changes in stocks and bonds. But because they also carry lower margin requirements, similar to those on options contracts, many experts say they could be riskier for many consumers. Initially institutional investors and businesses are expected to be the biggest customers for these new products."
"RICHARD KLEIN remembers his first puff only vaguely: he was 12, and sneaked around the corner at school with some friends. His last is equally indistinct: It was a couple of years ago in a bar in Paris. He smoked about half of the single cigarette he had been carrying around, and decided not to finish the rest. The decades in between were filled with packs of Marlboros and Gitanes, too many to count. ""You never smoke just one cigarette,"" says the 53-year-old professor of French at Cornell. ""It's always connected to the one that came before and the one that will come after.""</br></br>The decisive moment for Klein came in his mid-thirties, as he watched his body start to decline. ""I was making efforts to exercise, and discovered the effects smoking had on that. I realized I had to do something about this habit, and for the next 10 years began to struggle manfully."" He also began to read Kant, in particular The Critique of Judgment and his theories about the sublime.</br></br>The addiction, the struggle against it and the philosopher came together to produce Cigarettes Are Sublime, an elegant and erudite examination of the question: If cigarettes are so bad, why do so many people insist on smoking them? ""There is nowhere in the world,"" the author notes, ""where people do not smoke if they are allowed to do so.""</br></br>A cigarette offers what Kant terms a ""negative pleasure"": an intimation of infinity, a safe glimpse into the void. ""Warning smokers or neophytes of the dangers entices them more powerfully to the edge of the abyss, where, like travelers in a Swiss landscape, they can be thrilled by the subtle grandeur of the perspectives on mortality opened by the little terrors in every puff,"" Klein writes. ""Cigarettes are bad. That is why they are good - not good, not beautiful, but sublime.""</br></br>Quoting the book out of context - cigarettes, according to one passage, are ""one of America's proudest contributions to the world"" - can make it seem like Klein is secretly employed by the tobacco companies. Actually, he makes clear upfront that he's stopped smoking, is glad of it, and isn't trying to encourage anyone else. After all, his whole point is that smokers don't need much encouragement."
"Howard Shaffer left a comfortable job with the Nike company in 1985 to start a new business here in partnership with a sleepy Chinese concern called the Long March Leather Shoe Factory. What happened over the next few years illustrates why industrial output in this region in southern China is now soaring at more than 25 percent per year.</br></br>Shaffer said he began his joint venture here by insisting on modern, capitalist management techniques and ""breaking bad habits"" among the Chinese workers, such as sleeping on the job. After just three months, productivity had quadrupled, to about six pairs of shoes per day for each employee from Long March's old level of 1.5 pairs.</br></br>By the end of the decade, Shaffer had expanded his operations to three factories here, and was making up to 650,000 pairs of shoes a month for such U.S. companies as Timberland, Thom McAn and Stride Rite - and for his old employer, Nike. His sales in 1990 totaled $74 million. Asked about profits, Shaffer just smiled.</br></br>Welcome to Guangdong Province, the freewheeling, free-market area along China's southern coast that, by local estimates, is currently among the fastest-growing economic regions in the world.

But a better slogan for the new Guangdong might be: ""Money, Money, Money.""</br></br>Guangdong's real industrial output grew during the 1980s at an average annual rate of 19.7 percent, which analysts here said was by far the fastest of any province in China.

Now, the company spends less than half that amount.</br></br>For years, a shortage of drivers was the single biggest problem for the trucking industry. Con-way, J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. and other companies spent millions of dollars annually trying to attract applicants for a notoriously unappealing job that involves spending weeks on the road, sleeping in cramped cabs and showering at dirty truck stops. Annual driver turnover has routinely approached or exceeded 100%.</br></br>In the cut-throat competition to lure new drivers, companies offered everything from signing bonuses to letting drivers take their pets on the road.</br></br>Now, these trucking companies suddenly have more applicants than jobs, thanks to a recession-driven jump in applications from the ballooning ranks of the unemployed and a decline in the number of trucks on the road as freight volumes plummet. In January alone, the industry, which employs roughly 1.32 million people, lost 25,000 jobs, according to the American Trucking Associations.</br></br>Some companies say they are seeing a tripling or quadrupling of inquiries from types of people who have historically snubbed driving a truck.

"WASHINGTON -- The first significant sign that the economy is cooling emerged when the Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate rose for the first time in more than a year.</br></br>The unemployment rate for January jumped 0.3 percentage point to 5.7%, matching October's level. The Labor Department also reported that employers created only 134,000 jobs last month, about half the pace of previous months and the smallest gain in a year.</br></br>While economists were careful to note that the new data suggest the economy is still growing, many agreed the report seems to indicate the year-long series of interest-rate rises engineered by the Federal Reserve finally have kicked in.</br></br>""It takes about 12 months for the rate hikes to have an effect,"" said Edward Yardeni, an economist at C.J. Lawrence. ""This is the year we'll see it happen.""</br></br>The financial markets rallied on the news as investors speculated that interest rates may soon stop rising.

"Your Dec. 13 editorial ""New York State of Tax"" is right on the mark, with one major exception. Gov. Andrew Cuomo's property-tax cap isn't, as your editorial claims ""filled with loopholes that many towns have exploited."" The only significant exclusions from the cap are for a portion (and only a portion) of any extraordinary increase in pension bills, set at a level so high it will rarely be triggered, and for debt service on school-district capital projects approved by voters. An allowance is also made for added taxes generated in any given year by physical additions to the property-tax base. This clause is expressly intended to give municipalities an incentive to favor much-needed new development.</br></br>Mr. Cuomo's tax-levy cap, modeled closely on the successful Prop. 2.5 cap in neighboring Massachusetts, is much tighter and more effective than, for instance, Gov. Chris Christie's tax cap in New Jersey. Two years after its enactment, the New York cap is clearly making a difference -- especially in school districts, where a cap override requires a supermajority vote of 60% of taxpayers. Because it is set at the lesser of 2% or inflation, the cap will range from 1.6% to 1.7% for most municipalities in 2014.</br></br>Unfortunately, Mr. Cuomo so far has been unwilling to combine the tax cap with meaningful local-mandate relief, especially public-sector collective-bargaining reforms that would give county executives, mayors and school boards more tools to live within the cap.</br></br>What New York needs now is lower local costs, not new state-subsidized giveback gimmicks in the name of ""property-tax relief.""</br></br>E.J.

"ST.

""Desi"" DeSimone said.</br></br>The company's internal forecast is for domestic economic growth of about 2% in the second half. Characterizing the U.S. economy as ""stratified,"" Mr. DeSimone said in an interview that the company expects some ""laggard areas"" to perk up in coming months. ""They won't have to do a whole lot better in construction and automotive to have an improvement,"" he said, adding that ""I think the health-care industry might do a little better.""</br></br>The company is a major supplier of abrasives and fasteners to the automotive and construction industries and sells a wide range of items to the medical community.

"Despite a decade of technological advances that make it possible to work almost anywhere, many of the nation's most educated people continue to cluster in a handful of dominant metropolitan areas such as Boston, New York and California's Silicon Valley, according to census data released Thursday.</br></br>The upshot is that regions with the most skilled and highly paid workers continue to widen their advantages over less well-endowed locales.</br></br>""In a knowledge economy, success breeds success,"" said Alan Berube, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C.</br></br>Of the largest 100 metropolitan areas, those with the highest percentage of college graduates in 2000 outpaced in education gains areas with lower percentages of college grads. For instance, the 10 cities with the highest share of their population holding a bachelor's degree or higher saw that share jump by an average of 4.6 percentage points over the decade, while the bottom 10 saw their share grow 3.1 percentage points.</br></br>Those higher-educated areas also tend to be the highest-earning. In the San Francisco metro area, where 43% of adult residents have a college degree or higher, the median household income stands at $73,027. Nationwide, 28.2% of people aged 25 and older have a college degree, and the median household income is $50,046."

The median fell by 3.8% in California and by 2.9% in Arizona and Florida. Those four states are among those that have seen the biggest falls in home values and housing construction since the financial crisis, and where Americans are still struggling with the resulting heavy debt and high unemployment.</br></br>Nationally, the median income dropped by 1.3% to $50,502 in 2011.

It shows that despite 2011's marking the second full year of the recovery, poverty continued to rise in many regions. An estimated 335,760 people fell into poverty in California alone last year, pushing up the state's poverty rate to 16.6%. Poverty is defined as an annual income of $23,021 or lower for a family of four."

"WASHINGTON -- The share of after-tax income going to the superrich -- a percentage that soared in the go-go 1980s -- stopped rising in the recession of the early 1990s, new data fron the Congressional Budget Office show.</br></br>The data indicate that the top 1% of Americans, who in 1996 will reap an average of $438,000 in after-tax income, saw their slice of U.S. income stay at about 12% from 1989 to 1992, the latest year for which such data are available. Before that, their share had skyrocketed to 12.4% in 1989 from 7.3% in 1977, the first year the CBO began collecting the data.</br></br>The CBO results, analyzed by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, an independent liberal think tank, appeared to contradict some politicians and analysts who have said the rich are gaining at the expense of the poor.</br></br>Will this alter long-held views? Not likely. For one thing, the superrich stagnation occurred during a recession that hit the wealthy as well as the poor.</br></br>Moreover, more-recent data suggest that the rich's share of income is rising again. Data released last month by the U.S. Census Bureau showed that the top 5% wealthiest Americans saw their share of aggregate income shoot up from 1992 to 1994, after it slipped a bit during the recession. Census data aren't as complete as CBO data, in part because they don't measure the top 1% of Americans. But the census data are more up-to-date."

"When Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady unveiled a new U.S. strategy in March 1989 to reduce some of the huge debt Third World nations owed to commercial banks, his aides listed 39 nations that might be eligible for help.</br></br>Brady's was a revolutionary idea, compared with the idea that had preceded it. Brady contemplated actual debt relief or forgiveness, financed by about $30 billion put up by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and Japan.</br></br>The old strategy, the Baker Plan, called for new loans on top of the old ones. That practice simply helped debtor nations pay off interest obligations, while preserving the fiction that the banks' loans were still productive. Write-offs force the banks to acknowledge real losses.</br></br>Nineteen months after the inception of the Brady Plan, however, the great majority of poor countries are still overwhelmed by massive commercial debt, their economies laid to waste by high unemployment and negative per-capita growth induced by failure to control their exploding populations. The biggest single act on the debt-relief front was a diplomatic gesture arising out of the Persian Gulf crisis: American forgiveness of $7 billion owed by Egypt (which wasn't being paid anyway).</br></br>The Brady Plan, at $30 billion, is under-funded. But in today's capital-short global economy, it's hard to believe that additional funds for debt relief can be found. Meanwhile, the flow of regular loans has been reduced to a trickle, in part because the borrowing countries have largely quit making payments to the banks-and because some banks, especially in America, are going through hard times."

"Visions of doomsday comfortably behind them, investors continued pouring money into high-tech stocks today, pushing the Nasdaq composite index to yet another record.</br></br>But while euphoria buoyed tech stocks on the first trading day of the year 2000, bond prices fell to their lowest levels since May amid rampant expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise rates to slow the economy, now that the Y2K bug is quashed.

The index registered 55.5 in December, indicating that U.S. manufacturing expanded for an 11th straight month.

"MOST EVERYONE on Wall Street predicted the dollar's three-year bear market would get even worse this year. And, despite its impressive rally in recent months, most are again calling for dollar declines in 2006.</br></br>With the U.S. currency climbing to a fresh two-year high against the euro Friday and hovering around a 26-month best against the yen, there are nascent signs the bearish consensus may be splintering. A few analysts are even arguing that the dollar could strengthen further next year.</br></br>That could have implications for stock investors. Too strong a currency can hurt exporters by making their goods less globally competitive, weighing on earnings. Some fund managers say a stronger dollar could increase stock prices by helping squelch inflationary pressures. That would keep interests rates from rising too quickly and abruptly slowing the economy.</br></br>""We're looking for a continuation of the dollar rally,"" says Gary Thayer, chief economist for A.G. Edwards and one of the rare dollar bulls at the end of last year. ""And we think we're close to a point where others may also start to begin thinking more favorably about the dollar.""</br></br>That day may be closer than he suspects. A Dow Jones Newswires survey of 18 banks last week showed a median forecast for a dollar decline of about 9% against the euro and the yen by the end of next year. These dollar forecasts are rosier than ones made three weeks ago, reflecting a broad, if modest, shift in thinking that the dollar can at least hold its gains longer than expected."
"The stock market has its own discount store, and analysts say prices have rarely been cheaper.</br></br>The discounts can be found among closed-end funds, those peculiar mutual funds that trade on the stock exchange.

""This is the time when you should step up to the table and enjoy the feast.""</br></br>How do closed-end funds differ from regular mutual funds? If you trade a regular fund, you simply buy or sell shares from the fund involved. The only price you need worry about is the fund's net asset value, which is the value of the fund's portfolio holdings expressed on a per-share basis.</br></br>But with closed-end funds, you also have to keep tabs on a fund's publicly traded shares. Unlike regular mutual funds, closed-end funds issue only a limited number of shares. The fund is then closed, and its shares are listed on the stock market."

Geffen is reportedly spending a fraction of his windfall on a $47 million estate in Beverly Hills.</br></br>A few blocks away, at A&M Records, founders Jerry Moss and Herb Alpert, the trumpeter, are sitting on $500 million, the haul from the sale of their company in October to the Dutch-owned PolyGram Inc.</br></br>Shrewd operators all, Geffen, Moss and Alpert may have cashed out at just the right time. Fed by the startling success of the compact disc, the recording industry finished its best year ever in 1989-but is showing incipient signs of losing its groove.</br></br>As measured in dollars, record sales grew only 3 percent last year, less than the inflation rate and the slowest growth since 1985, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. Unit shipments were up 5 percent, thanks mainly to the CD, but cassettes-still the backbone of the business-actually experienced a slight decline. Even the CD explosion begins to look a lot less dynamic for record companies in light of the inexorable fall in CD prices and profit margins: The average disc sold for $12.49 last year, down from $15.63 in 1986."
"Industrial production fell for the fourth straight month in November and has now dropped further than during the 1960-61 recession, Federal Reserve figures showed yesterday.</br></br>The announcement came after President Nixon hailed ‰ÛÏthe first trillion-dollar economy for any nation in the history of the world.‰Û</br></br>Mr. Nixon spoke at Commerce Department ceremohies where a new economic growth clock indicated the nation‰Ûªs gross national product crossed the $1,000,000,000,000 mark at 12:13 p.m.</br></br>Later in the day the President conferred with Federal Reserve Board Chairman Arthur F. Burns, an old friend with whom lie has been having polite differences over economic policy.</br></br>White House aides and other government officials were close-mouthed on what the two discussed. But there was a general assumption that they touched on monetary and fiscal policy as well as suggestions made publicly by Burns last week for the ‰ÛÏincomes policy‰Û to which Mr. Nixon has been consistently cool."
"If our Washington, D.C., readers noticed a cortege of blue suits carrying a casket in front of the Brookings Institution last week, be not mournful. You were merely watching the leading economists of the Democratic Party burying the faith once known as Rubinomics. May it rest in peace.</br></br>Rubinomics is the concept of ""deficit reduction"" as growth policy: Lower the federal budget deficit and, as dawn follows night, interest rates will fall and prosperity will break upon the land. Named for former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, and much celebrated in the 1990s, the concept was embraced as gospel by nearly all Democrats as recently as a few weeks ago. But last week it officially expired, as those same Democrats reconverted to Keynesian deficit spending in the name of ""economic stimulus.""</br></br>Mr. Rubin's successor at Treasury, Larry Summers, started the bidding with a $65 billion tax rebate and spending plan. Hillary Clinton saw that and raised, and now wants $40 billion in tax rebates and $70 billion in new spending for unemployment insurance, housing assistance, home heating subsidies and green technologies. Barack Obama joined the fray Sunday, proposing a $75 billion ""stimulus"" that would have the government send millions of Americans a check for $250, plus another $250 in bonus Social Security payments.</br></br>But wait, what about those evil Bush deficits? Only weeks ago, Democrats claimed those were the road to perdition, even if the deficit had shrunk to 1.2% of GDP last year thanks to booming revenue growth. Remember the imperative of ""pay as you go"" budgeting? Ah, that was all before Iraq faded as a political winner and the economy became their favorite issue for regaining the White House. Now, all of a sudden, their motto is tax cut and spend.</br></br>""Stimulus shouldn't be paid for,"" declared Mrs. Clinton on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. ""The stimulus, by the very nature of the economic problems we're facing, is going to require an injection of federal funding."" And no less than the oracle himself, Mr. Rubin, appeared at Brookings last week to declare that a deficit-padding stimulus ""can give the economy a timely boost in the face of great uncertainty and concern with the short-term economic outlook."" The coroner will note that the cause of death here is suicide."
"Running big budget deficits threatens the health of the U.S. economy and could cut the nation's standard of living, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said.</br></br>The budget deficit totaled $319 billion last year, less than in 2004 but still the third-largest deficit ever recorded. This year, the White House forecasts a budget deficit of $423 billion -- a record in dollar terms.</br></br>As baby boomers start retiring and collecting Social Security and Medicare benefits, the budget will come under ""severe pressure,"" Bernanke said in a written response to questions from Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) after the Fed chief's remarks at a congressional hearing on the economy in February.</br></br>U.S. retail sales fell last month after the biggest gain in more than four years, as auto purchases declined and the return of cold weather discouraged shoppers.</br></br>The 1.3 percent decline was the first decrease in six months and followed a revised 2.9 percent rise in January that was larger than initially estimated, the Commerce Department said. Excluding automobiles, sales fell 0.4 percent last month after rising 2.6 percent in January."
"Monday, October 8, 1990</br></br>The key U.S. and foreign annual interest rates below are a guide to general levels but don't always represent actual transactions.</br></br>PRIME RATE: 10%.

"LONDON, Oct. 29‰ÛÓFaced with intense political pressure today to cut British interest rates. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told Parliament that action on the U.S. budget deficit was ""the most important single thing‰Û needed to restore stability to international financial markets.</br></br>In an acrimonious exchange, opposition Labor Party leader Neil Kin-nock called for ""significant cuts‰Û in interest rates, beyond the ""inconsequential‰Û half percentage point reduction that brought British base rates down to 9.5 percent last week.</br></br>But Thatcher fended off the questions and quickly focused on the ""vital‰Û need for ""early and decisive action‰Û in Washington.</br></br>""I welcome the talks President Reagan is having with Congress about cutting the U.S. budget deficit,‰Û Thatcher said. She called for measures that, ""both in scale and content, go beyond what has previously been envisaged, yet would do more than anything else to bring back confidence.‰Û</br></br>American economists and politicians, including many who have long urged the administration to raise taxes and cut government spending, now are debating whether those measures might actually deepen the current crisis by throwing the economy into a recessionary deep freeze."
"Regan predicted yesterday that interest rates will fall through the end of this year if federal spending is reduced and said that the Federal Reserve does not need to ease monetary policy to ensure an economic recovery.</br></br>‰ÛÏI think that interest rates will come down as it is perceived that these [budget] deficits are down and will stay down,‰Û Regan said in an interview.</br></br>He disputed the forecast of some analysts that interest rates will turn up again later this year when the expected recovery boosts business loan demand again at the same time the Treasury‰Ûªs own borrowing needs are rising sharply.</br></br>Rates will fall ‰ÛÏnot sharply, not plummeting in a straight line, but coming down over the period between now and the end of the year,‰Û</br></br>Regan said. The Treasury secretary does not anticipate a significant rise in business loan demand as a result of the recovery. To the contrary, he said, rising sales will improve companies‰Ûª cash positions in the third and fourth quarters, enabling them to cut back on their short-term bank borrowings."
"The economic slump has yet to damp innovation in Silicon Valley, at least not by one widely followed measure: patent production.</br></br>Silicon Valley denizens received 13,231, or 7.9%, of the total 167,350 ""utility"" patents granted in the U.S. in 2009, according to IFI Patent Intelligence, a unit of Wolters Kluwer Health that analyzes patent data from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. That is on par with Silicon Valley's share of patents nationwide in 2008 and 2007, according to IFI.</br></br>Utility patents are typically granted to those who invent or discover a new and useful process or machine.</br></br>Darlene Slaughter, IFI's general manager, said Silicon Valley's patent production was especially strong compared with other areas of the country, outstripping New York, for instance, which drew 5.3% of total utility patents in 2009. Texas generated 3.5% of such patents last year, and Massachusetts produced 2%.</br></br>The 2009 numbers could come as a relief to Silicon Valley executives and investors, who recall how the recession of the early 2000s crimped research and development."
"For the past several months, Americans have watched the stock markets drop, watched their 401(k)s and mutual funds shrink and raged at corporate executives who defrauded investors and employees for personal gain. It's reassuring to see that as a nation we are adjusting to these problems, making needed repairs and moving forward.</br></br>President Bush has signed legislation to improve corporate accountability and auditor oversight; the Securities and Exchange Commission has sharpened its focus; and executives and directors in boardrooms across America are scrutinizing and improving their practices to ensure accurate information for investors.</br></br>The enduring performance of our economy -- even following terrorist attacks on our political and financial capitals, corporate scandals and the end of the dot-com bubble -- has been a testament to the character of our nation. Confidence in our financial markets, in turn, does not come from talking heads on television. It derives from the economic fundamentals, which today are strong. Our economy is growing, and inflation and interest rates are low. Homeowners are refinancing their mortgages, giving them more cash to spend each month, and our economy has created additional new jobs for two months in a row. When the economic fundamentals are strong, personal incomes rise and our prosperity is more secure.</br></br>President Bush has been focused on these fundamentals since he took office, emphasizing the principles of economic freedom: simpler and lower taxes, freer trade, homeland security and fiscal restraint. Quick action last year, when the president cut taxes and the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, shortened and reversed a recession. Today our recovery is underway, and Americans are going back to work. And the president is continuing to reinforce the foundations to strengthen our recovery and to protect the savings that working Americans set aside for their economic security.</br></br>First, we are continuing to improve our tax system, by working to make tax relief permanent and to simplify our tax code. Predictability and simplicity should be our bywords. Predictability so that families, investors and small business owners can invest for the future and hire new workers without fear of surprise new costs imposed by the government. Simplicity because our overwrought tax code is an abomination. It diverts vital resources away from job creation and productive investments, puts U.S. employers at a competitive disadvantage and raises prices for consumers."
"GREENSBORO, N.C. -- Walking by the railroad tracks, a nattily dressed 74-year-old man turns and stares defiantly at an approaching headlight. A black Norfolk Southern Corp. locomotive thunders in his direction. Moments before it passes him, he steps aside -- reluctantly.</br></br>""Trespassers,"" Walker Rucker says, hissing at the 130-ton locomotive.</br></br>Mr. Rucker, a part owner of these tracks, is making his mark by standing in the way of a railroad. For more than two years, he has managed to stop Norfolk Southern from renewing its lease on a crucial, 317-mile stretch of track. His one-man crusade has featured a proxy fight, a lawsuit and statewide mailings.</br></br>Norfolk Southern, which recently acquired 58% of Conrail Inc. for $5.9 billion, is trying to rewrite the map of American rail freight by creating the first-ever seamless rail connection between the bright lights of New York and the green fields of the Deep South. Its chairman, David Goode, has launched his own personal appeal to North Carolinians. In a speech to business leaders in Charlotte earlier this year, he said it would be a ""real tragedy"" for the state if Norfolk removed its trains, which he said it would do if the lease isn't renewed.</br></br>The track in dispute -- stretching from Charlotte, through Greensboro and Raleigh, to Morehead City on the coast -- is owned by North Carolina Railroad Co. The railroad was founded by Mr. Rucker's great-great-grandfather and former North Carolina governor, John Motely Morehead."
"District Commissioner F.

A Democrat, he expects to be replaced at any moment by a Republican.</br></br>He said he hoped the new Commissioner would continue the 15-minute weekly discussions of District affairs so city residents may be kept ‰ÛÏcontinuously informed‰Û of local government problems.</br></br>Donohue said police and fire pay raises, which he has been pushing during his two-year stay at the District Building, are absolutely essential to prevent loss of protection by resignations and a lack of recruits in both department?.</br></br>-But, he stated, according to present budget estimates a larger Federal pavment will be needed to meet the increase."
"The following is a report of how some major bills fared recently in Congress and a record of how local members of Congress voted.</br></br>For-22 l/Agalnst-202 The House sent the Senate a bill (HR 743) giving companies leeway under federal labor law to operate employer-employee groups for addressing workplace issues and increasing productivity. The bill was supported by the Chamber of Commerce and opposed by the AFL-CIO. The 1935 National Labor Relations Act makes it an unfair labor practice for companies to financially support or dominate employee organizations. This bill eases that ban so that management and workers in nonunion shops can participate in Japanese-style problem-solving teams set up and administered by management. Critics say such teams easily can become illegal company unions. A yes vote was to pass the bill.</br></br>The House rejected an amendment requiring secret-ballot elections to pick employee representatives who sit with management on workplace teams authorized by HR 743 (above) within the framework of the National Labor Relations Act. The elections were to replace management selection of worker representatives. The amendment was backed by labor groups and opposed by business organizations. A yes vote supported the labor-backed amendment.</br></br>The House sent the Senate a bill (HR 1170) making it more difficult for the federal judiciary to block a referendum approved by the voters of a state. The bill requires appeals on constitutional grounds to be heard by three U.S. judges rather than one, to prevent plaintiffs from ""judge shopping"" to find a sympathetic jurist. The bill was prompted by events in California, where Proposition 187 denying social services to Illegal immigrants was approved by voters but found unconstitutional by state and federal courts and not implemented. A yes vote was to pass the bill.</br></br>The Senate sent to conference with the House a bill (HR 2099) appropriating $80.9 billion In fiscal 1996 for a variety of departments and agencies. The bill cuts the Environmental Protection Agency budget by 22 percent, the Department of Housing and Urban Development by 19 percent and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration by 4 percent. Among major agencies funded by the bill, only the Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Science Foundation escape major cuts. Senators preserved the space station (below) but killed the administration‰Ûªs AmeriCorps program (below). A yes vote was to pass the bill."
"Conseco Inc. ended its efforts to acquire Kemper Corp. after the financing for the buyout began to unravel.</br></br>Kemper, a big mutual fund, life insurance and brokerage company, said it is still for sale. But investment bankers say Kemper is now a less attractive property, because of the collapse of Conseco's offer and because higher interest rates have hurt Kemper's earnings prospects.</br></br>Analysts predict that any buyer that surfaces now would bid far less than Conseco's original $67-a-share, $2.7 billion, offer, or its recent proposal to lower its bid to $60 a share, or $2.4 billion.</br></br>""When Conseco does a deal, they are very, very thorough,"" said Joanne Morrissey, president of Firemark Group, a Parsippany, N.J., insurance-research firm. ""This doesn't bode well for Kemper."" Conseco and Kemper consented to cancelling the original takeover agreement, a step that frees the two sides from any legal obligations. ""It became clear to both parties that the proposed merger, even under Conseco's revised terms, could not be completed,"" said David Mathis, Kemper chairman. ""Our board remains committed to the goal of maximizing value for our stockholders.""</br></br>General Electric Capital Corp., which once bid $60 a share for Kemper, is exploring another run at Kemper. But the General Electric Co. unit has yet to notify Kemper of its plans, if any. SunAmerica Inc., a Los Angeles-based insurer, also would be interested at the right price, according to a person close to the company. Dean Witter, Discover & Co. and Chubb Corp. have previously shown various degrees of interest. Yesterday, none of the companies had any comment."
"In the matter of Occupy Wall Street, the allegedly anticapitalist movement that's been camped out in lower Manhattan for the past few weeks and has inspired copycat protests from Boston to Los Angeles, we have some sympathy. Really? Well, yeah.</br></br>OK, not for the half-naked demonstrators, the ranting anti-Semites, Kanye West or anyone else who has helped make Occupy Wall Street a target for easy ridicule. But to the extent that the mainly young demonstrators have a valid complaint, it's that they are trying to bust their way into an economy where there is one job for every five job-seekers, and where youth unemployment runs north of 18%. That is a cause for frustration, if not outrage.</br></br>The question is, outrage at whom? On Wednesday, Occupy Wall Street marched on J.P. Morgan Chase's headquarters, after having protested outside CEO Jamie Dimon's home the previous day. That's odd, seeing that J.P. Morgan didn't take on excessive mortgage risk and didn't need (although it was forced to take) TARP money. The demonstrators also picketed the home of hedge fund mogul John Paulson, who made much of his recent fortune betting against the housing bubble, not helping to inflate it.</br></br>As for Wall Street itself, on Tuesday New York state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli issued a report predicting that the financial industry will likely lose 10,000 jobs by the end of next year. That's on top of the 4,100 jobs lost since April, and the 22,000 since the beginning of 2008. Overall New York-area employment in finance and insurance has declined by 8.9% since late 2006. Even Goldman Sachs is planning layoffs.</br></br>So much for the cliche of Wall Street versus Main Street, the greedy 1% versus the hard-done-by 99%. That may be the core conviction of Occupy Wall Street and its fellow-travelers, and it may be a slogan in nearly every Democratic campaign next year, including President Obama's. Whether or not that's smart Democratic politics, the voters will decide."
"Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>WASHINGTON -- Analyze this: The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking to hire an organizational psychologist with the goal of improving employee attitudes and job satisfaction by reducing burnout, conflict and stress.</br></br>The newly created full-time position would pay as much as $147,978 a year. Applicants must have a degree in psychology, preferably a master's or Ph.D.</br></br>The SEC psychologist would be expected to make recommendations on productivity, team building and diversity, and develop ""innovative solutions to complex psychological issues."" According to the SEC's job posting, the appointment is for two years, with a possible two-year extension.</br></br>The online job posting has been circulated via e-mail throughout the SEC. Some employees said they find it so hilarious they feel compelled to share it with co-workers. Others privately grouse at the idea. They say hiring a psychologist is a waste of money, and they predict that disgruntled SEC staffers will quickly jump to better-paying private- sector positions once the job market picks up."

"AuthorAffiliation Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</br></br>The deficit in goods narrowed $1.3 billion to $12.48 billion, while the services surplus shrank, too, to $5.42 billion from $5.58 billion.</br></br>The November deficit represents the fourth consecutive month in which the trade deficit narrowed, according to yesterday's Commerce Department report. Clinton administration officials quickly seized on the November improvement as evidence that America's worrisome trade deficit has finally turned around for good. ""Obviously, we're going in the correct direction,"" U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said. He and Commerce Secretary Ron Brown noted that the trade picture improved despite weak economic growth in Canada, Mexico and Japan, the major U.S. trading partners.</br></br>But economists, while surprised by the narrowed deficit, cautioned that the U.S. trade picture isn't exactly radiant and the deficit isn't likely to keep shrinking in coming months. ""Our trading partners are probably under the same kinds of competitive pressures which we are,"" said Alan Levensen, an economist with UBS Securities in New York. Foreign producers, he said, are encountering sluggish U.S. demand in much the same way U.S. exporters have been plagued by weak demand abroad. ""We've improved so much in November that you'll see a widening after this,"" he predicted.</br></br>The trade gap with China, which expanded most of last year, contracted in November to $2.75 billion from October's $3.63 billion. But that's not likely to ease deepening trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. Yesterday, Mr. Kantor, who has been monitoring reports that China sold nuclear weapons-related equipment to Pakistan last year, warned that the ""overall atmosphere"" between the U.S. and China ""does have some effect"" on trade issues. That includes whether the U.S. will slap more than $1 billion in trade sanctions on China if Beijing doesn't crack down on copyright violations."

To do so, Barneys may need to reduce other debt mostly held by hedge-fund manager Richard Perry and supermarket magnate Ron Burkle.</br></br>The debt load is mostly the result of a private-equity takeover of the company five years ago that burdened it with an additional $500 million in debt.</br></br>Istithmar World, the investment arm of state-owned Dubai World, paid $942.3 million for Barneys in a buyout at the top of the market in 2007. Istithmar in early 2010 invested another $20 million to boost Barneys' coffers as it struggled in the wake of the recession."
"TORONTO--The Canadian dollar was little moved Thursday, as investors grappled for clarity on the status of negotiations to avert the so-called U.S. fiscal cliff.</br></br>U.S. lawmakers were offering distinctly different views how budget talks were going. House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) said no ""substantive progress"" had been made, while Democrats said a deal could be reached before Christmas.</br></br>The U.S. dollar was at C$0.9930 late Thursday, from C$0.9921 late Wednesday, according to data provider CQG.</br></br>Investors worry that Congress won't be able to reach a budget deal to avoid the U.S. fiscal cliff, and that the series of tax increases and spending cuts slated to take effect on Jan. 1 will send the U.S. economy back into recession.</br></br>In economic data, the U.S. economy expanded at its fastest pace in nearly three years in the third quarter, but analysts voiced concerns about the details of that report.

"Prime Minister Tony Blair enjoys a booming economy and enviable public approval ratings, but his decision on whether to call a national election for May has been complicated by the crisis surrounding the foot-and-mouth epidemic on Britain's farms.</br></br>Under the parliamentary system, Blair can choose the date for national elections. He is said to be eager to dissolve Parliament and hold an election quickly, with May 3 as his preferred date. Blair has to decide by Monday, and he's receiving conflicting advice from across the political spectrum. A choice that once seemed almost automatic has suddenly emerged as a crucial test of Blair's political instincts and courage.</br></br>While most members of Blair's governing Labor Party appear to favor a May election, several have joined the call for a delay until the farm crisis has been controlled. William Hague, leader of the chief opposition Conservative Party said today that a May election would be an ""arrogant"" choice that ""puts the interests of one party ahead of the country.""</br></br>In the rural communities worst hit by the epidemic, farm groups are bitter at the very thought of a May election. ""There's a sense that he's throwing us over the side to advance his own political agenda,"" said Mike Downham, a livestock farmer in the northern county of Cumbria.</br></br>Rural voters generally don't back Labor, so Blair presumably wouldn't lose many votes if he angered farmers. But if city and suburban voters decide that it is callous to mount a campaign during a crisis, that could cost the Labor Party votes it badly needs, both in the parliamentary election and in the hundreds of city and county elections also scheduled for May 3."

"Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>The dollar was little changed versus the euro and the yen as a late- session climb carried the U.S. currency back to day-earlier levels.</br></br>After declining in Asia, the dollar traded in narrow ranges versus the euro for most of the European and North American sessions. However, a late-session rise in oil prices hurt the yen and some emerging-market currencies and helped lift the dollar back to the levels of late Tuesday, said Brian Garvey, currency strategist at State Street Global Markets.</br></br>The dollar's late rally also meant the U.S. currency held on to the gains it had made over the previous nine sessions versus the yen.

"The crush of multiple snowstorms over the past week may have frozen economic activity for a couple of days, but it's unlikely to ice the economy's rebound.</br></br>Snow accumulations broke records across a wide swath of the eastern U.S., closing schools and governments, canceling flights and shuttering private businesses. But ""Snowmaggedon's"" swift blow to business activity isn't expected to last.</br></br>""Generally, these kinds of things don't have a meaningful effect on the economy,"" said Moody's Economy.com economist Mark Zandi. ""It affects the timing of economic activity, but in terms of dollars and cents these kinds of things don't add up to much.""</br></br>Losses from weather events come in two forms: One is business that can be made up, such as retail sales that shift to a later date--the sweater not bought today, but bought next week. The other is transactions like restaurant meals, which are lost forever because people can't make it through snowdrifts to spend money. Economists believe most disruptions cause business to shift, rather than be lost, which is why the longer-term impact is muted. The reality is that both go on simultaneously. The storm kept travelers out of Washington, D.C.'s hotels, for instance, but some filled up rooms with local residents who lost power at home.</br></br>That's why Jill and Michael Gold checked into Washington's downtown Mayflower Hotel last Saturday with three children and four pets, including a dog named Ziggy and a gecko named Gordon. They checked out Tuesday, just as another storm was about to wallop the nation's capital."
"IN COLLEGE, Stephen Fenig specialized in foreign affairs. In the recession, he is specializing in firewood.</br></br>Fenig, who is 21 and graduated from the University of Virginia last year, discovered, quickly, that there were few jobs in his specialty. To have any hope at all, he would have to getanadvanced degree.</br></br>Suddenly Fenig‰Ûªs horizons shrank from their international proportions. Remembering the energy crisis of last winter, when people were stockpiling firewood as if it were gold bullion (or sugar or toilet paper or paper bags), he decided to help satisfy what he thought would be a comparable demand this year.</br></br>He bought a truck, a power saw, some wedges, an ax, a sledge hammer and some expensive accident insurance and began looking for trees that could be converted into cords of firewood that, delivered and stacked, would sell for $60.</br></br>in places as distant as Orange County and as close as construction sites in his neighborhood in Falls Church, Fenig found enough hickory and oak logs to get started in business."

"After improving in September and early October, markets in a wide variety of debt -- including for home mortgages, consumer loans, and corporate buyouts -- have sharply deteriorated in recent weeks. Investors view much of this debt as riskier than they did even at the height of the August credit crisis and are requiring higher interest rates as compensation.</br></br>While markets are behaving in a more orderly fashion than they were in August, many on Wall Street fear that the situation will get worse before it gets better. ""This is just dragging on longer,"" said Axel Merk, a portfolio manager for Merk Hard Currency Fund. ""We're very early in this.""</br></br>Economists increasingly worry that banks are suffering such massive losses that they will be forced to cut back their lending to consumers and businesses. That would slow the economy, much as the savings and loan crisis did in the early 1990s. Yesterday, an analyst predicted that Citigroup, the world's biggest financial services company, would suffer another $15 billion in losses in the coming six months from its exposure to exotic types of debt.</br></br>That prediction, along with fresh negative data about the housing market, drove the Dow Jones industrial average down 218 points, or 1.7 percent. Financial markets are pointing to a strong possibility of even more bad news.</br></br>For example, futures markets indicate that there is a 20 percent chance that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by half a percentage point or more at its next policy meeting Dec. 11, even though it is widely understood that the central bank would do so only if there were highly negative economic news between now and then. An index measuring the cost of insuring against credit losses on 125 financially sound companies reached an all-time high yesterday. And the market for securities backed by commercial real estate loans, which had been little affected through the August crunch, is showing strain."
"After stock prices closed at a post-crash high Monday, investors were debating whether money managers would commit more cash to the market or whether profit-taking would stem the rally. The answer turned out to be ""yes"" on both points.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down a scant 1.16 at 2070.46. Declining issues edged advancing stocks 799-712 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume fell to 200 million shares from 236 million the day before.</br></br>""There was something for everybody in the market"" yesterday, Jon Groveman, head trader at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co., said. ""If you're bullish, it was a consolidation, and the market is behaving very well. If you're a bear, it's negative that there was no follow-through from Monday's rally.""</br></br>Mr. Groveman said any profit-taking yesterday was offset by cash inflows from money managers anxious that they might miss a continuation of Monday's rally. He blamed the market's waffling on the absence of any factors to fuel a move in either direction, after an increase in takeover activity pushed prices higher Monday.</br></br>""I think the fate of the stock market is still in the bond market,"" Mr. Groveman said. ""Bonds seemed to have a very, very difficult time breaking out of a trading range in the past week. With the bond market staying in one place, there isn't any question that the stock market will have a lot of trouble making a sharp move up from this level."""
"WHEN ROBERT and Juanita Silvia had their sixth child in February 1973, the ‰ÛÏblessed event‰Û was decidedly a mixed blessing. In fact, it was a bit of a jolt, because 16 months earlier Robert had a vasectomy that he thought made him sterile.</br></br>The daughter born that day is in kindergarten and, the parents say. is a well-loved, ‰ÛÏwanted‰Û child. Nevertheless, the North Attleboro, Mass., couple went to court recently ‰ÛÓ as others in similar circumstances have done ‰ÛÓ and sued Dr. Robert N. Hayward of Foxboro who had performed the vasectomy.</br></br>Although their case is far from unique, such cases are almost always controversial. And in this case, like many others, the hottest issue is not the nature of the surgery itself nor how it was done, but the kind of damages the suit seeks.</br></br>The Silvias‰Ûª suit not only asked the doctor to pay the medical costs of the unwanted pregnancy and delivery; it did not stop with compensation for the pain and inconvenience the pregnancy entailed.</br></br>Their claim plunged well beyond to try to force the doctor to pay the estimated cost of raising the girl until she reaches 18, the age at which a parent‰Ûªs legal obligations to the child cease."
"THE FINANCIAL markets could use a few good inflation watchers these days as soaring oil prices and a strong economy stoke concerns about rising consumer prices.</br></br>Among economists regularly surveyed by The Wall Street Journal, two have stood out for their ability to forecast inflation: Gail Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board, and Maria Fiorini Ramirez, of MFR Inc. Unfortunately, for those in need of guidance, the two economists now see things very differently. Ms. Fosler expects inflation to pick up by year's end while Ms. Ramirez sees inflation easing off a bit.</br></br>Collectively, the 56 economists in the Journal surveys have been expecting headline inflation to move down from the 3% rate posted early in the year, as prices for energy and other commodities ease. The consensus of the economists who participated in the latest monthly survey is that the consumer-price index will rise 2.5% on an annual basis by year's end. But that consensus is creeping up. The group was looking for a CPI increase of 2.3% two months ago.</br></br>Getting a fix on inflation and oil is becoming increasingly important. Higher consumer inflation could push up interest rates and erode the purchasing power of households, which could eventually derail economic growth. Right now the economy is sending off mixed signals on the outlook. While commodity prices have soared, manufacturers have had difficulty passing higher costs on to consumers.</br></br>Forecasts reflect the confusion. Among economists who have participated in the survey for at least three years, only nine accurately predicted the inflation rate would slow in 2003, when it dipped below 2%, and then accelerate again in 2004, when it shot up over 3%."
"Rising interest rates didn't scare first-time buyers away from the home market last year, according to a new national study.</br></br>Chicago Title and Trust Co.'s telephone survey of recent buyers found that 47.1 percent were first-time buyers, compared with 46 percent in 1993. Since first-time buyers are usually the most price-sensitive, last year's 2-percentage-point jump in mortgage rates to above 9 percent for a 30-year, fixed-rate loan could logically have been expected to push them out of the market.</br></br>But in an analysis of its survey results, Chicago Title speculated that because these buyers didn't have to sell their old home before buying a new one, they were in the best position early in the year to move quickly when it became obvious that rates were on the way up.</br></br>As the year wore on, first-time buyers chose adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) to keep their monthly mortgage payments down, said John Pfister, vice president and marketing research manager at Chicago Title.</br></br>The company, which sells title insurance, has been surveying buyers for 19 years and conducts its poll on a representative sampling of buyers in 18 major markets, including the Washington area."
"FRANKFURT--Allianz SE said it will increase its dividend-payout ratio for this year so that shareholders aren't penalized for an expected decline in net profit that the insurer said doesn't adequately reflect its performance.</br></br>Chief Financial Officer Oliver BÌ_te told reporters and analysts the ratio will be higher than the usual 40% of net profit, as the company's operating earnings are stable, even though the company now expects 2011 net profit to be ""well below"" last year's figure of [euro]5.05 billion ($6.87 billion).</br></br>Mr. BÌ_te said net profit is vulnerable to negative non-operating losses from volatile markets. He declined to be more specific. Allianz paid a dividend of [euro]4.50 a share for 2010.</br></br>The company, Europe's largest primary insurer by market capitalization, said it nonetheless remains on track to reach its targeted full-year operating profit of between [euro]7.5 billion and [euro]8.5 billion. The company considers operating profit to a more effective measure of its performance than net profit, and third-quarter operating profit fell less than analysts had expected.</br></br>Allianz shares climbed 5.6%, or [euro]4.05, to [euro]76.25, as investors focused on that part of its earnings."

Tomorrow, he is expected to travel to Miami, where he is expected to press reluctant lawmakers to approve the Latin American trade deals and resist election-year pressures to turn away from free trade.</br></br>The push for action on the bilateral agreements comes as the Doha Round of global trade talks appear to be sinking deeper into deadlock. The effort reflects concern among senior Bush officials over the growing sentiment among Americans against expanded free trade and globalization."
"NEW YORK--Long-dated U.S. Treasurys pushed into their fourth-straight winning session after details from the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting showed more monetary support is ready in the wings should the economic recovery falter.</br></br>Minutes from the April Federal Open Market Committee meeting revealed ""several members"" acknowledging that more stimulus could be necessary if the recovery loses momentum.

"With the long drop in interest rates, corporate zero-coupon bonds haven't been getting much attention lately.</br></br>That's probably just as well for many investors. But for others, some market professionals say, corporate ""zeros"" could be worth a fresh look.</br></br>Zero-coupon bonds, which are issued at a steep discount from their face value, were very popular when rates were high. Not only could investors ""lock in"" a high rate of return for years to come, they didn't have to worry about how to reinvest periodic interest payments because there aren't any. Instead, investors profit from the difference between the issue price and the face amount payable at maturity.</br></br>Last year, however, corporations issued only $703.3 million of zero-coupon bonds, according to IDD Information Services Inc. That was less than a third of the record $2.46 billion issued in 1985.</br></br>Uncertainty about tax overhaul discouraged both issuers and buyers in 1986, but lower interest rates were the major factor.

"Washington -- PRESIDENT BUSH NOW sits at the very political crossroads his father occupied more than a decade ago.</br></br>Military victory in Iraq seems assured, but the domestic U.S. economy is deteriorating. How Mr. Bush handles it between now and November 2004 is likely to determine whether he wins re-election or is voted out after one term, as his father was. Just hours after watching Iraqis clamber on a fallen statue of Saddam Hussein, Mr. Bush brainstormed yesterday with Chief of Staff Andrew Card and legislative liaison David Hobbs to figure out a way to salvage his $725 billion tax-cut package, under siege on Capitol Hill.</br></br>""He's in the catbird seat,"" says Princeton University's Fred Greenstein, a presidential historian. ""But it ain't over till it's over.""</br></br>The president and his Republican Party clearly have reason to celebrate. The administration's war plan appears to have succeeded without triggering bloody and protracted urban warfare, a spike in oil prices or use of weapons of mass destruction. If history is any guide, Mr. Bush will see a boost in public-opinion polls that will lengthen his advantage over prospective 2004 opponents.</br></br>Mr. Bush still faces big challenges in Iraq. They include the prospect of continued sporadic fighting and casualties, and the complicated task of overseeing humanitarian relief and reconstruction in Iraq. The White House's insistence on taking the lead in rebuilding Iraq could undermine the very government they help create and further alienate European allies, whose financial assistance will be critical to a process some estimate could cost an annual $25 billion for many years to come. The administration's approach already has irritated some fellow Republicans in Congress -- and provided a target for the Democrats running to oust him from the White House next year."
"Some local activists predicted that thousands of Washington area immigrants would participate in a national economic boycott today, but immigrant groups who have spoken out against the boycott said they fear that the immigration reform movement is being commandeered to promote political causes beyond immigration.</br></br>The public tug of war, which continued in the Washington area yesterday on Spanish-language radio, could result in more limited participation in the region than is expected in Dallas and Los Angeles, where the organizers of last month's massive protests have been more unified in support of today's boycott, which asks immigrants to refrain from buying goods and to stay home from work and school.</br></br>Police in Los Angeles said they expect a rally that could draw as many as a half-million people. Some major national firms that rely heavily on immigrant labor said they would close for the day. Perdue Farms said about half of its chicken processing plants would close, and Tyson Foods Inc. said nine of its 15 beef and pork plants will not operate.</br></br>Local business owners said they did not know what to expect. Some said they would close, and several construction firms said they would allow their employees to take the day off.</br></br>Ricardo Juarez, coordinator of Mexicans Without Borders in Northern Virginia, and a local leader of the boycott, predicted that ""real economic impact"" would be felt in the Washington area."

"A senior Japanese official said yesterday that a resumption of heavy Japanese capital investment in the United States depends on the stability of interest rates and exchange rates.</br></br>Toyoo Gyohten, vice minister of finance for international affairs, said that if market conditions are stable, ""I am sure that Japanese investors will continue to find that it's quite safe to invest in the United States.""</br></br>The attitude of Japanese investors is important because the U.S. Treasury has relied on heavy Japanese purchases of its securities to help finance the federal budget deficit, and strong Japanese participation has been a factor in the rise of U.S. stock markets.</br></br>Gyohten said the correlation between the flow of investment money and foreign exchange market stability could be seen in the drop in Japanese investments here from $4.6 billion in January and $6.7 billion in February to less than $1 billion in March and $2 billion in April after the dollar fell and long-term interest rates rose.</br></br>But he told reporters prior to his speech here to the U.S./Japan Economic Agenda that the underlying trend in Japan is pushing interest rates higher, and that U.S. interest rates also are moving up. He cited an inflationary trend in the Japanese economy and the Federal Reserve Board's recent increase in its discount rate."
"This may come as a surprise to those of you who have bought anything in Connecticut recently, but: The state is a pretty affordable place to live.</br></br>How can that be? After all, prices in Connecticut for everything from utilities to groceries and health care are 22% higher than the nationwide average, according to an index compiled by the latest edition of the Connecticut Economy, a quarterly publication from the University of Connecticut.

"The Federal Reserve stood pat on interest rates Wednesday, but it was hardly out of complacency.</br></br>Caught between heightened inflation fears and persistent concerns about a sluggish economy, Ben Bernanke and his fellow policy makers decided to leave the Fed's key short-term interest rate unchanged at 2%. The non-move marked the end of a series of rate cuts dating back to last summer, when credit woes were creeping up on the economy. The latest vote was 9-1, with Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, once again dissenting, this time opting for a rate increase. And, indeed, recent comments from Fed personages -- including Wednesday's commentary -- suggest the bank's next rate move will be upward. ""Although downside risks to growth remain, they appear to have diminished somewhat, and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased,"" the Fed said in its statement. The bank is in a bit of a pickle. Reporter Sudeep Reddy writes that Fed officials are trying to avoid rate increases for now to avoid exacerbating the weakness in employment, financial markets and the housing sector. At the same time, they are trying to signal they're serious about fighting inflation by talking about the risks of rising inflation expectations and suggesting a willingness to act quickly if inflation expectations get out of hand. Assuming commodity prices don't go completely haywire, some economists think that won't happen, as the weakening economy, particularly the rising unemployment rate, restrain wages and a willingness to spend. Indeed, Joseph Brusuelas of Merk Investments thinks a rate increase won't be happening anytime soon. ""We anticipate that the rate hike currently priced in [by markets] for September will wither away in the heat of the summer slowdown in the economy,"" he said. Likewise, PNC economist Stuart Hoffman, while now more convinced that the Fed's next move will be an increase, sees the federal-funds rate holding at 2% until ""late 2008 or early 2009.""</br></br>---</br></br>Stocks Inch Up</br></br>The Federal Reserve's announcement gave the Dow Jones Industrial Average a quick boost, but in the end the blue-chip gauge was ahead only 4.40 points, or 0.04%, at 11811.83.

A latecomer to Latin America, the consumer-goods giant is scrawny in the region and is using a blossoming antitrust climate to help it catch up by filing lawsuits and snitching to antitrust cops. Although businesses around the world routinely seek to gain advantage over competitors by appealing to regulators, the scope and intensity of P&G's efforts to use Latin America's regulatory system to improve its competitive status are extraordinary.</br></br>The maker of Tide, Crest and Pampers employs more than two dozen lawyers in Latin America, with fully one-third of their time devoted to exposing practices it considers prejudicial.

"To hear Republicans talk, Rep. Charles B. Rangel, the gravel- voiced New York Democrat who stands to take over the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, is ""giddy"" about the chance to undo popular tax cuts enacted during President Bush's first term in office.</br></br>But Rangel said yesterday that he had no intention of rolling back the cuts, most of which are scheduled to expire in 2010, if Democrats claim the House on Nov. 7.</br></br>""I think it would be ridiculous for us in 2007 to be talking about 2010 tax cuts,"" Rangel said in an interview. ""I don't want to go retroactive in terms of any of the tax cuts. I think retroactive tax increases are bad tax policy.""</br></br>As the prognosis for Republicans to maintain control has grown increasingly gloomy, Rangel has become a favorite rhetorical punching bag for President Bush and Republican leaders. At fundraisers, in news releases and on the campaign trail, Republicans have been warning voters that a Democratic House would raise taxes and wreak havoc on the nation's economic recovery. They raise the specter of Rangel's bejeweled hands on the controls of federal tax policy like some terrifying Halloween goblin.</br></br>Last week, House Majority Leader John A.

Chairman Andrew C. Hove Jr., Fiechter, Comptroller of the Currency Eugene A. Ludwig and Federal Reserve Board Governor Lawrence B. Lindsey are used to worldly discussions of economics in sedate marbled chambers. But yesterday they went a few miles from their downtown Washington offices to a world where it costs $1.99 to cash a $25 check and 29-cent stamps cost 40 cents.</br></br>They were there to get a first-hand look at why working-class blacks on Central Avenue patronize expensive check cashing outfits instead of banks and why upper-middle-class blacks in $200,000 Lake Arbor town houses complain that they have to go to mortgage companies because banks won't lend to them."
"Small-cap consumer stocks climbed Thursday on some better-than- expected May sales reports, offsetting renewed concerns surrounding a return of rising oil prices.</br></br>Also helping stocks was a surprising drop in the number of jobless claims last week, as the number of U.S. workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to a six-week low, signaling some improvement in labor-market conditions ahead of Friday's employment report for May. As a result, key small-cap indexes closed at highs for 2008.</br></br>Leading the way for consumer stocks was teen retailer Buckle, which continues to report outsize increases. The company posted a 35% increase in May same-store sales; in the first four months of the year, the lowest growth was January's 19%. Buckle ended the day up $1.72, or 3.7%, at $48.57 on the New York Stock Exchange. Among other small-cap retailers posting better-than-expected May same-store sales, Cache rose 1.89, or 15%, to 14.59, while Hot Topic increased 89 cents, or 17%, to 6.16.</br></br>The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks climbed 19.56 points, or 2.63%, to 763.27, and the Standard & Poor's SmallCap 600 rose 9.34 points, or 2.38%, to 402.07, marking their biggest one-day gains since April 16. Both closed at their highest points this year.</br></br>The biggest one-day dollar increase in crude oil traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange did little to stop the momentum of consumer stocks, while driving several energy names higher.

"The market didn't crash. The 684-point fall doesn't even make history's top 10 percentage declines. And so we may conclude that if Congress now does the right thing quickly on tax policy, the market will rise.</br></br>Problem is, the early indications we're getting is that Congress may enact a new tax bill using conventional means, such as tax credits, mainly to shore up the largest corporations. Incentives at the margin will be minimal. That is, half a loaf.</br></br>The outlook would be considerably more worrisome had the market's indices spent the whole of yesterday in a steady, precipitous decline. The reality is that most of the day's 7.13% loss occurred in the first hour of trading, and remained fairly flat through the day.</br></br>A 684-point drop is a rough ride, and the burden on the market at the opening bell was substantial. The economy before last week was already in the doldrums, with little upside evident so far from a series of interest rate cuts, or for that matter the tax rebate. Much of the airline industry has suffered for years from fixed union costs that leave little room for sustained profitability. The closure of the air transport system may have merely pitched several airlines toward inevitable dissolution, which would be reflected in yesterday's trading.</br></br>That said, share prices generally rose in Europe, and Asia's losses were modest. It is a small miracle that trading in New York opened at all; most likely operations will smooth in the weeks and months ahead. Most importantly, all available evidence suggests that the men and women who make up the American economy are prepared to move heaven and earth to prove that their system will not be defeated by homicidal barbarism."
"Unemployment in Virginia rose to a new post-World War II high of 8.4 percent last month, the Virginia Employment Commission reported yesterday.</br></br>The jobless level in January on the same unadjusted basis was 7.8 percent, which, until the February figures were reported, was the highest since the war. The sharp jump in unemployment last month was because of layoffs in the auto component, furniture and textile industries, the VEC said.</br></br>In addition, there was a rise in the number of people looking for work, and who were therefore counted in the labor force, VEC analyst William Mezger said. There were 220,200 Virginians out of work in February, compared with 203,200 in January, he reported. Meanwhile, the labor force expanded by 16,600 people during the month, a large increase for the time of year.</br></br>The comparable national rate of unemployment in February was 9.6 percent. After seasonal adjustment, the national rate was 8.8 percent. Most economists expect the underlying jobless level nationwide to rise even further in coming months. However, as the weather improves there is usually a seasonal decline in the numbers out of work in the spring and summer months. The VEC predicts that the jobless rate for March will stay at about the February level.</br></br>Unemployment varies widely across the state, although there were increases last month in five of the six major urban areas.

"Banks are tightening lending standards for businesses and consumers -- even beyond real-estate loans -- and companies' demand for credit has weakened, a new Federal Reserve survey of senior bank-loan officers shows.</br></br>The January survey offers the hardest evidence yet that the credit crunch is spreading. Although banks also reported some tightening of lending requirements on credit cards and other consumer loans, commercial and industrial loans have been the most severely affected.</br></br>One-third of the U.S. banks and about two-thirds of the foreign banks responding told the Fed they had tightened lending standards on commercial and industrial loans during the three months ended Jan. 31. About half the banks said they have widened the spread between their cost of funds and what they are charging borrowers.</br></br>""Bankers are becoming more cautious,"" said Keith Leggett, economist at the American Bankers Association in Washington, ""but also borrowers are getting more cautious.""</br></br>About a third of the banks participating in the survey reported weaker demand for commercial and industrial loans, while about one in 10 reported strong demand. Among those that saw a reduced appetite for loans, ""a decrease in customers' needs to finance inventories and investment in plant and equipment"" was cited frequently. Additionally, 70% of the respondents cited a drop in businesses' needs for merger- and-acquisition financing as a reason for lower demand."
"The rate of unemployment across the 17 countries that share the euro rose to a record in May, and is likely to increase further despite signs that the currency area's longest postwar contraction may be coming to an end.</br></br>High rates of unemployment, particularly , have become the main concern for euro-zone policy makers in recent months as more pressing threats to the continued existence of the currency area have appeared to abate.</br></br>A number of governments have decided to take more time to cut their budget deficits, partly in order to limit the loss of jobs. And European leaders Friday agreed to set aside [euro]8 billion ($10.41 billion) annually in order to tackle high levels of youth unemployment, a figure many economists regarded as far too small.</br></br>But even with an easing in the pace of austerity, and more direct interventions to create jobs, the rise in unemployment is unlikely to come to an end soon.</br></br>""A contracting economy and major fiscal consolidation across the region have been the main drivers of rising euro-zone unemployment,"" said Anna Zabrodzka, an economist at Moody's Analytics. ""Despite signs of improvement, this year will be challenging for euro zone's economy.

"VIENNA -- The euro zone will avoid a double-dip recession despite signs of weakening in Germany's economy, a top European Central Bank official said, suggesting the hurdle for interest-rate cuts or other stimulus remains high.</br></br>In an interview, Austrian central bank Gov. Ewald Nowotny struck back at recent criticisms from the U.S. over Europe's handling of the Greek debt crisis, saying Europeans can handle their own affairs.</br></br>He also expressed frustration at the increasing demands being placed on the ECB to contain the debt crisis, and signaled there is little more the central bank can do to spur growth. ""I do not think there are many possibilities for further specific actions,"" Mr. Nowotny said in the interview Monday in Vienna.</br></br>The ECB at its Sept. 8 meeting downgraded its outlook for the rest of this year and 2012, a surprising reversal for a central bank that raised interest rates two months earlier. Many economists took that as a signal that the ECB might lower its main policy rate, currently 1.5%, if needed to protect the recovery. Other major central banks, such as the Federal Reserve and Bank of England, have policy rates closer to zero, leaving the ECB as the only major developed-country central bank with any firepower on rates.</br></br>Yet Mr. Nowotny's remarks suggest officials would need to see much more weakness to spur a rethink on interest-rate levels."
"Compounding the strictly economic problems are profound political-economic difficulties: The Reagan administration was able to deal with renewed economic problems by temporarily raising military spending, devaluing the dollar to stimulate exports and cutting taxes to produce economy-boosting Keynsian deficits. All these major economic cards have now been played.</br></br>AS .THE ECONOMY continues to send contradic-tojry signals, a disturbing question arises: Is it conceivable that the United States has entered a period not simply of recession and temporary cyclical downturn, but of long-term, persistent stagnation?</br></br>It so, the kinds of policies it will take to get us out of the economic doldrums‰ÛÓand the political reappraisal needed to bring jpolicymakers to consider them‰ÛÓare likely to be far more [wrenching than most Americans are yet willing to contemplate.</br></br>Stagnation has been evident in numerous economic indicators for a considerable period. In 1990, for instance, median household income adjusted for inflation was $1,000 less than; it was 17 years earlier. Between 1977 and 1988 average wages and salaries of the bottom 90 percent of the population fell 3.5 percent. Wages for a young male high school graduate entering the job market in the late 1980s were 18 frercent lower than in the late 1970s. Now, even if we expedience a modest resumption of growth, most forecasters expect it to be so tepid as to produce virtually no improvement in the unemployment rate.</br></br>The idea that we may be confronted with ongoing stagnation is| not something many experts have been willing to talk ope ply about.

"PARIS, July 28 (NYHT).‰ÛÓ For a couple of years now hardly a week has gone by without the announcement by the Economic Cooperation Administration, and latterly by the Mutual Security Administration, that at least one French productivity mission has left for the United States to study American methods of management, manufacture, or distribution.</br></br>Individual cases of success and of failure are on record by the dozen, but no over-all evaluation of the ambitious program can be made except in general terms. Two important things have surely been accomplished. First, the American equipment and techniques introduced have, in the aggregate, made a substantial contribution to the national output per man hour. Second, French employers and, to a less extent, French unions and workers have become productivity conscious.</br></br>For instance, the annual report issued over the weekend by the nationalized Renault Automobile Co. devotes a long section to tfie year‰Ûªs advances in productivity. It records that the man hours per unit of production, which was 653 in 1947 and 564 in December, 1950, had jbeen brought down by December, 11951, to 550. It also states that during the year, despite strong opposition from the Communist-dominated union in the factory, a branch of the Confederation Generate du Travail, 880 suggestions were received from workers. Of these 119'were put into effect, and 113 were rewarded with sums as high as every cent the French government (with American aid) and French employers are putting into it. But alone it ‰Û÷is 'not going to bridge the gap of about 3-to-1, which still exists between the productivity and standards of living of the American and French worker.</br></br>Georges Lasserre, a financial writer for the independent conservative newspaper Le Monde, comments today that too many French employers and technicians go to America with the idea that they will find some wonder gadget, or some trick technique, which will double their production overnight.</br></br>He majccs the point that it would be much more useful in the long run if they sought to find out why every American employer and every enlightened American labor union is constantly seeking to increase productivity. Why, in short, there is the industrial atmosphere which in the last analysis is responsible for the high standard of American productivity."
"Most advertising on the World Wide Web these days isn't much different from what you find on television, radio and even roadside billboards. Advertisers can select Web sites like they would TV channels or radio stations, but after that, it's one size fits all. Everyone gets bombarded with the same pitch.</br></br>Nobody who runs a Web business wants it that way. In theory, the Web is the ultimate tool for targeting specific ads to specific people. Unlike other media, every bit of information that shows up on your computer screen when you're on the Web is sent directly to you by specific Web sites.</br></br>Web ads could be like, well . . . junk mail. Just as catalogues from fly-fishing equipment companies tend to show up at the homes of people who stayed in hotels in fly-fishing country, ads appearing on the screen would be targeted to the viewer's interests.</br></br>Doing so, however, isn't simple. Determining just who is visiting a particular Web site -- and what their interests are -- is the number one frustration for many marketers.</br></br>One way is to offer people a trade: a free service in exchange for personal data about themselves, which they type into a screen form -- age, sex, hobbies, what appliances they own, whether they traveled in the past six months, etc. Then, when they use the service, the system knows who they are and displays ads matching their interests."
"It isn't often that Canadians get to boast about having one of the world's top-performing stock markets, but hot technology and communications stocks have put Canadian indexes in the limelight.</br></br>Though Asian markets generally fared even better last year, Canada handily outperformed the U.S. and most of Europe. Many investors still think of Canada's stock market as a play on natural resources. However, surging shares of such high-tech names as Nortel Networks Corp., BCE Inc. and JDS Uniphase Corp.

"Henry Kaufman's criticism of six of the main premises and conclusions put forth in Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's speech of October 15 could use a seventh element ("","" op-ed, Oct. 20).

"Somehow Rep. Augustus Hawkins (D-Calif.) knew the last days of his 28 years in Congress would be marked by an executive slap. Months ago, the Bush administration promised to veto the Civil Rights Bill of 1990 if the version Hawkins cosponsored was sent to the White House. It happened Monday.</br></br>Bush issued his three-page veto message and Hawkins immediately issued his two-sentence reply. He had prepared it Thursday, two days before the bill went to the White House, and in his blunt, succinct fashion he called Bush the leader of ""a national retreat from civil rights. ...

Although the specific phrase has been eliminated from the alternative bill the White House sent to the Hill last weekend, Hawkins says the idea of a preference is simply an updated endorsement of bigotry. This provision would have allowed businesses to argue that they were responding to their clientele's wishes when charged with discrimination.</br></br>""That's how far we've drifted and fallen,"" said Hawkins, seeing the phantom of the no-blacks-allowed signs he saw on the road from Los Angeles to Sacramento on his way to the state Assembly 56 years ago.

"TOKYO -- Japan's merchandise-trade surplus more than quadrupled in January from a year earlier, as cheaper oil prices held down the value of imports and exports expanded by a healthy 9.7%.</br></br>The surplus widened to $3.84 billion from a revised $911 million a year earlier, marking the 13th consecutive month of year-on-year increases, a fact that is certain to put more political pressures on Japan to narrow the imbalance.</br></br>The trade surplus with the U.S. rose for the sixth straight month, climbing 2.4% to $2.45 billion from $2.40 billion. Exports to the U.S. increased 1% to $6.73 billion. Auto exports fell 19.4% in volume and 12.3% in value. Imports from the U.S. inched up 0.3% to $4.29 billion. But excluding a near-quadrupling in the volume of aircraft imports during the month, imports from the U.S. actually dropped 2%.</br></br>Many analysts said the numbers were in line with expectations and noted that January figures can be skewed by Japan's long New Year's holidays. Nevertheless, most analysts expect the surplus to widen through the year. One of the lessons from the January figures is that they show that ""a stubborn recession in the U.S. isn't going to stop Japanese exporters from selling their products,"" said Jesper Koll, chief economist at S.G. Warburg Securities (Japan) Inc.</br></br>Mr. Koll said the 9.7% gain in overall exports in January shows that Japanese producers are selling their ""record large inventory buildup into the overseas market.""

"Thanks to several years of fiscal restraint during the 1990s, the burden of federal spending dropped to 18.2% of gross domestic product by the time Bill Clinton left office. The federal budget today consumes more than 24% of economic output, a one-third increase since 2001 in the share of the U.S. economy allocated by politics rather than market forces. That makes the Republican House budget, which would reverse this trend, extremely important for the economic health of the country.</br></br>Both political parties deserve blame for the spending spree that's put America in a fiscal ditch. President George W. Bush was a big spender and President Obama has compounded the damage with his stimulus spending and other programs.</br></br>But the era of bipartisan big government may have come to an end. Largely thanks to Rep. Paul Ryan and the fiscal blueprint he prepared as chairman of the House Budget Committee earlier this year, the GOP has begun climbing back on the wagon of fiscal sobriety and has shown at least some willingness to restrain the growth of government.</br></br>The Ryan budget has generated considerable controversy in Washington, and it will become even more of an issue now that Mr. Ryan is Mitt Romney's running mate. So it's an appropriate time to analyze the plan and consider what it would mean for America.</br></br>The most important headline about the Ryan budget is that it limits the growth rate of federal spending, with outlays increasing by an average of 3.1% annually over the next 10 years. If spending is left on autopilot, by contrast, it would grow by 4.3% (or nearly 39% faster). If President Obama is re-elected, the burden of spending presumably will climb more rapidly."

"Average together absolute euphoria and dreary disappointment and what do you get? The 2.97% advance of the average stock mutual fund in the first two months of this year.</br></br>Behind that small gain, as calculated by Lipper Inc., lies a huge disparity in results: Some conservative stock funds favoring seemingly cheap ""value"" stocks tumbled 15% or more over the course of January and February, following a rough 1999. Meanwhile, ""growth"" funds that invest in the stocks of the fastest-growing companies continued to soar, with some gaining 40%, 50% or more in a mere 60 days.</br></br>Indeed, at a time when investors are still agog over the triple-digit returns posted last year by more than 175 funds, a few funds that specialize in the recently red-hot biotechnology sector broke the 100% barrier in just the first two months of this year. Those triple-digit gainers include specialized health/biotech offerings from the Orbitex, Nicholas-Applegate and Dresdner RCM fund families.</br></br>The stock market's split personality comes to life in the voices of mutual-fund managers at the two ends of the performance spectrum.

"AuthorAffiliation Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</br></br>But why can't it? A small but growing chorus of critics is beginning to question the mainstream view and ask whether economic policy makers aren't waging the wrong war.</br></br>Bruised by two decades of inflation and deficits, officials here and in other industrialized countries are keeping tight rein on budget and monetary policies; they are determined not to repeat past mistakes. In the process, some fear, they may also be throttling the chances of job-creating expansion around the world. This new wave of government austerity, critics argue, saps potential growth in many mature industrial economies even as those in Asia and elsewhere are soaring, heralding a historic shift in economic power.</br></br>The fast-growth gang extends beyond the usual cliques of liberal economists and supply-side enthusiasts. And it extends beyond Clinton-administration officials with their eyes on the November election. Included are people from across the political spectrum, both here and abroad, plus a growing number of corporate bosses. They contend that the world economy has changed fundamentally, and they complain that central bankers, led by the Federal Reserve, respond too slowly. Low unemployment won't trigger higher prices as it once did, they say; instead, global competition and corporate restructuring will keep prices down, while productivity gains will let growth flourish.</br></br>Above all, the critics want central bankers to relax their tight-money policies. ""We have to be willing to take more risks"" for faster growth, says Dana Mead, chief executive of Tenneco Inc., the Houston energy giant. ""We can't afford not to."" Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, says a recent survey finds an overwhelming majority of manufacturing executives calling for lower rates. High rates ""are choking off growth,"" he says. ""We need a more pro-growth policy coming from Washington."" John F. Welch, General Electric Co.'s chief executive, says the economy can safely grow faster than its current 2% rate, ""and we ought to let it."""
"Loudoun County budget officers dipped into public school reserves to help fill a $28 million revenue shortfall this week, surprising the School Board, which was saving money for the lean years expected ahead.</br></br>The county's chief financial officer, Mark D. Adams, said the transfer amounted to a ""rebalancing of accounts"" after an audit of the fiscal year that ended June 30, which showed that some funds were low and others high. Adams said the accounting change would not affect services or operations for the county or the schools this year.</br></br>Unfortunately for the school system, most of the low funds were on the county side. The county had expected to end the year with a balance of $39 million, but depressed real estate revenue led to a balance of $11 million. The school system was in better shape and ended the year with a surplus of $36 million.</br></br>The School Board had hoped to save the surplus for next year. Early estimates put the schools' shortfall for next fiscal year at $70 million.</br></br>The county decision prompted the School Board to schedule a special meeting Monday to talk to its attorneys and grapple with the effect of the funding transfer. Vice Chairman J. Warren Geurin (Sterling) said the board is ""not pleased"" with the changes when ""Loudoun County's checkbook does not balance."""
"After a quarter such as the past one, when equity markets worldwide climbed to multiyear highs, dropped like a stone and then bounced, what's a small investor to do?</br></br>Retail investors have a history of overreacting to market swings in harmful ways. They poured into technology stocks right before the bubble burst in 2000, and many of them were so shell-shocked by the ensuing decline that they piled out of equities altogether and missed most of the bull market of the past three years.</br></br>""What happens is a perverse form of market timing, rushing in at high prices and panicking out at low prices,"" said Richard Hoey, chief economist for Dreyfus Corp. ""It's a mistake for you to assume you know what is going to happen in the market in the future,"" Hoey said.</br></br>Follow the long-term plan. Most financial advisers suggest that investors follow an asset-allocation strategy with fixed percentages of their money in bonds, cash and various types of stocks, such as large U.S. companies, small companies and international companies. Over the past three years, small-company stocks and stocks in the developing world have shot up much faster than those of large American companies, so many investors may find their portfolios out of balance. Now might be a good time to capture some of the gains and reinvest the profits in areas that haven't grown as quickly.</br></br>""If you were biting your nails during the last downturn, it might be a sign you need to diversify.

"This suburb, contiguous with Chicago's western edge, is 88 percent white. A large majority of the customers of the Wal-Mart that sits here, less than a block outside Chicago, are from the city, and more than 90 percent of the store's customers are African American.</br></br>One of whom, a woman pushing a shopping cart with a stoical 3- year-old along for the ride, has a chip on her shoulder about the size of this 141,000-square-foot Wal-Mart. She applied for a job when the store opened in January and was turned down because, she said, the person doing the hiring ""had an attitude."" So why is the woman shopping here anyway? She looks at the questioner as though he is dimwitted and directs his attention to the low prices of the DVDs on the rack next to her.</br></br>Sensibly, she compartmentalizes her moods and her money. Besides, she should not brood. She had lots of company in not being hired: More than 25,000 people applied for the 325 openings.</br></br>Which vexes liberals such as John Kerry. (He and his helpmeet last shopped at Wal-Mart when?) In 2004 he tested what has become one of the Democrats' 2006 themes: Wal-Mart is, he said, ""disgraceful"" and symbolic of ""what's wrong with America."" By now Democrats have succeeded, to their embarrassment (if they are susceptible to that), in making the basic numbers familiar:</br></br>The median household income of Wal-Mart shoppers is under $40,000. Wal-Mart, the most prodigious job-creator in the history of the private sector in this galaxy, has almost as many employees (1.3 million) as the U.S. military has uniformed personnel. A McKinsey company study concluded that Wal-Mart accounted for 13 percent of the nation's productivity gains in the second half of the 1990s, which probably made Wal-Mart about as important as the Federal Reserve in holding down inflation. By lowering consumer prices, Wal- Mart costs about 50 retail jobs among competitors for every 100 jobs Wal-Mart creates. Wal-Mart and its effects save shoppers more than $200 billion a year, dwarfing such government programs as food stamps ($28.6 billion) and the earned-income tax credit ($34.6 billion)."
"NEW YORK -- A report that the Bank of Japan is tightening credit to curb inflation pressure rocked the credit markets as prices of Treasury bonds, financial futures and other debt securities sank.</br></br>""If the Japanese are serious about this, the only way for U.S. rates to go is up,"" said Steven A. Wood, an economist at Bank of America, San Francisco. ""And there is ample evidence to believe they are, which is why support in the bond market suddenly collapsed. We are so dependent on foreigners to finance our deficits that if the Japanese raise their rates, ours will have to rise as well just to maintain an attractive differential,"" Mr. Wood said.</br></br>The Treasury declined to comment on the report that the Bank of Japan is tightening monetary policy. Prices of actively traded 30-year government bonds fell more than 1 1/4 points yesterday, or over $12.50 for each $1,000 face amount. The yield on the latest 30-year Treasury issue climbed to 9.69%, matching the highest level for this year, which also was the highest since mid-December 1985, according to Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.</br></br>Many corporate and municipal securities also slumped. At the Chicago Board of Trade, where traders reported a late afternoon wave of sell orders from customers, Treasury bonds for delivery in December settled more than a point lower.</br></br>Earlier this week, Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita indicated at a meeting of insurance company executives that the central bank is shifting its credit stance amid signs of rising inflation.

"For oil prices, subject to such vagaries as Nigerian politics and Atlantic winds, rules of thumb are alluring.</br></br>One currently in vogue is that oil, priced in dollars, rises as the greenback falls. Working the other way, expensive oil widens the U.S. trade deficit, undermining the dollar.</br></br>Both arguments offer only a partial explanation. Oil has roughly doubled since February as the dollar fell 15% against the euro. But oil also roughly doubled in 2004 and 2005 while the dollar held steady.</br></br>Similarly, the U.S. trade deficit is subject to factors other than oil. For example, it ballooned in the late 1980s, even as oil prices sank. Meanwhile, Marc Chandler, author of ""Making Sense of the Dollar,"" questions how much trade deficits really drive the dollar anyway. While increasing U.S. exports coincided with a weakening dollar earlier this decade, exports were likewise on a roll in the late 1990s, when the greenback was also strong.</br></br>Changing correlations between the dollar and different assets suggest cyclical factors rule. The late 1990s and the middle part of this decade both saw strong U.S. economic growth and high or rising interest rates. Those contexts supported the buck, regardless of what oil was doing."
"‰ÐÊ M B ROF. PAUL HURD outlines a frightening na-. 'T7' tional trend on today‰Ûªs op-ed page. American precollege students are heading toward scientific and technological illiteracy in a world where se-‰Û¢curity and prosperity increasingly depend on sci---ence and technology. Dr. Hurd presented his warning to a convocation at the National Academy of Sciences last week.</br></br>At the meeting, educators told of steadily declining student achievement in mathematics and the V sciences and of less demanding and more out-of-J date curricula. School administrators confirmed an appalling shortage of science and mathematics teachers. The superintendent of Houston‰Ûªs public schools reported that thousands of students had graduated without ever having had a qualified math ;.or science teacher.</br></br>. Representatives of industry, both the new high-. technology companies and the traditional ‰ÛÏsmokestack‰Û industries, warned that they are already una-ble to find workers sufficiently trained and comfort-' able with mathematics and technology, and that . their need for such workers is going to grow steadily. The secretary of defense linked the problem directly to national security because of manpower ..needs in both the armed services and defense industries. Numerous speakers reminded the audience : 'that its literate work force has been a traditional ad-' vantage of the U.S. economy since the beginning of Tthe industrial age.</br></br>Specialists reported that while science and mathematics education been allowed to fall into decline in the United States, it is being accorded the highest priority elsewhere. Prof. Hurd illustrates some df the ominous differences between this and other countries. Yet even more than in. those other societies, democracy demands that citizens understand the choices they have to make. A very small number of American students are being vtell prepared'for careers in science and engineering, but nearly everyone else‰ÛÓabout 98 percent of high school graduates‰ÛÓis leaving school as a functional illiterate in these fields, in effect denied full citizenship.</br></br>Twenty-five years ago, Sputnik galvanized the United States into the realization that it had fallen way behind. This time, there is no single foreign threat‰ÛÓat least not yet‰ÛÓthough the problem may be worse. Last time, there was an immediate federal response and the programs worked, until funding and attention dissipated in the late ‰Ûª60s. This time, there is little or no federal money available and a disinclination to look toward Washington for a solution."

Since Cabinet officers are expected to testify, Burns decided he, too. had an obliga tion to appear before Congress if requested. However, he had to insist that no transcript be taken of his remarks of native troops.

Paul Douglas (D-I1L), an ex-professor of economics at the University of Chicago, promptly challenged him. Burns then went into a lengthy explanation, pointing out that in speaking off-the-cuff, he was apt to oversimplify a complex situation or to state an idea more positively than it ought to be expressed. Therefore, he preferred to keep his remarkg informal. If a transcript were made, he said, it would make his testimony appear more formal than it actually would be.</br></br>There was also the possibility, he continued, that he might say something that would appear to be in contradiction of . the President‰Ûªs Economic Report. He hastened to assure that he didn‰Ûªt mean he disagreed with the President‰Ûªs report in any detail.

The consensus forecast calls for non-farm payrolls to have risen a modest 83,000 in June.

"Mortgage interest rates soared to their highest point this year in reaction to Tuesday's half-point increase in the Federal Reserve's discount rate.</br></br>However, the rate increase came late enough in the peak summer selling season that the housing industry is still likely to turn in a strong year, analysts and housing industry and real estate professionals say.</br></br>The prevailing rate on 30-year fixed-rate loans purchased by Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. jumped to 10.82% yesterday from 10.50% Monday, and many adjustable-rate mortgages linked to short-term indexes are climbing past 10.6%, compared with 10.35% at the beginning of the month.</br></br>But although scores of lenders raised their mortgage rates after the Fed raised its discount rate -- the fee it charges on loans to financial institutions -- to 6 1/2% from 6%, lenders and real estate sales people said they expect the immediate impact to be slight.</br></br>In addition to the timing of the increases, economists and real estate sales professionals say adjustable-rate mortgages that often are initially priced below market levels continue to put a floor under sales and make the industry less sensitive to rate fluctuations.

"If last week's outcome of several anti-sprawl ballot measures is any indication, Southeast voters are more willing than ever to foot the bill for buying up land before real-estate developers can get their hands on it.</br></br>Now comes the hard part: Cities and counties from North Carolina's Research Triangle to South Florida must stretch public dollars far enough to please voters by curbing sprawl but not spend so much that they become too financially leveraged in the process.</br></br>Rising land costs in the region are making that increasingly difficult. Some local government officials project they'll have to spend significantly more than they did in the 1990s to shield only a fraction of the acreage. Land that's most threatened by development tends to be the most expensive to buy. So acquiring even small parcels can rapidly drain a public land-buying bank account, leaving a city or county with little to show for the effort.</br></br>Moreover, developers and property owners, in selling the increasingly scarce land, often attempt to inflate prices, thinking they can turn a quick profit at taxpayers' expense. Land-buying programs ""tend to create their own real-estate markets,"" says Andy Walker, former state director for the Nature Conservancy of Tennessee. With mounting frequency, he adds, cities and counties find themselves having to ""play hardball with land speculators who think their property is worth a lot more than it really is.""</br></br>In Broward County, officials are primed for tough negotiations after voters last week passed a $400 million bond package to purchase undeveloped land near the Everglades and improve existing parks.

Investors have about $30 billion linked to the Nasdaq 100 index, mostly through shares of the Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking Stock, an exchange-traded fund.</br></br>The yearly rebalancing of the Nasdaq 100 index is under way, and the index's members and candidates that can't attest to the honesty of their financial figures won't be allowed aboard.</br></br>The move -- whether more for symbolism or substance -- is the first of its kind among overseers of major indexes, with the Nasdaq's rule saying it will ""prohibit securities from being included if the annual financial statements of the issuer of the securities cannot currently be relied upon.""</br></br>Officials of Nasdaq, a unit of the National Association of Securities Dealers, said they plan to police the requirement by monitoring companies' financial filings, keeping tabs on corporate news releases and by following comments made by company executives. It is understood that the market won't require the companies to file special affidavits with Nasdaq."
"KKR & Co. pumped $1.2 billion into First Data Corp., an unusual move showing that its debt-fueled takeover of the payment processor seven years ago remains a burden for the buyout firm.</br></br>Credit-card processor First Data has been in the red since KKR took it over in 2007 for roughly $26 billion in one of the largest-ever private-equity buyouts. For a while, KKR refinanced First Data's hefty debt load to ease pressure on the company. Now, it is injecting equity as part of a $3.5 billion investment that includes $2 billion from pension funds, mutual funds, asset managers and wealthy individuals, KKR said Thursday. The total investment, among the largest of its kind, gives First Data a boost as it tries to rebound from previous losses and reshape its business.</br></br>KKR will invest $500 million from its fund that did the original buyout and another $700 million from its own cash, or balance sheet, the firm said.</br></br>Private-equity firms rarely put additional cash into a company they have bought years after closing the deal. Instead, these firms--which buy companies largely with borrowed money--often pay themselves by having the company borrow more money. Owners eventually try to sell companies or take them public. In the past couple of years, with stocks on the rise, conditions have been ripe for private-equity firms to sell out of investments they have held for years, including some stragglers.</br></br>But KKR hasn't been able to shed Atlanta-based First Data, which was weighed down by an outsize debt load taken on in the takeover. Thursday's deal gives First Data, which employs about 23,000 people and processes credit-card and debit-card payments for merchants and banks, additional cash to reduce by $375 million its annual interest payments on debt, KKR said."

"In 1973, Richard Nixon, in the teeth of the Arab oil embargo, pledged that the U.S. would achieve energy independence within seven years. Like his presidency, that didn't quite work out. Net imports provided 35% of U.S. oil in 1973. Seven years later, they supplied 37%, and by 2005, 60%.</br></br>Now, that trend is reversing fast. In the 12 months ended in August, net imports met just 46% of oil demand. Similarly, net imports of natural gas climbed from 4% of consumption in 1973 to a peak of more than 16% in 2007, but were back under 9% in the year ended in August.</br></br>This isn't energy independence. But just as America's growing energy-import dependence in the 1970s had implications of global proportions, so will this reversal four decades later.</br></br>In natural gas, the opening of shale resources has caused excess supply and cratered prices. Despite calls to use more natural gas, demand hasn't caught up. That is why the likes of Cheniere Energy now want to liquefy and export natural gas to cash in on the spread between low U.S. prices and much higher European and Asian ones.</br></br>Capturing the benefit of this price difference will be a central battle in the natural-gas market over the next decade. Exports of natural gas would tighten domestic supply, raising prices. That is risky politically. Michael Levi at the Council on Foreign Relations reckons those benefiting from the natural-gas glut--mainly utilities, petrochemical companies and heating consumers--are more organized politically than natural-gas producers and exporters. The argument that gas should be exported not in its raw form but as an input to American-made goods will be tough to ignore."

By contrast, the S&P 500 fell by just 1.8% during the same periods.</br></br>But unless Boeing Co.'s management changes its basically upbeat outlook or reports slippage in its delivery schedule, Wednesday's second-quarter results won't send investors into a brace position yet."

""Some statistics indicate that things are slowing down some.

"Once again, it‰Ûªs time to talk about the stock market. The reason, of course, is that last week Wall Street‰Ûªs most sacred icon, the Dow Jones industrial average, broke through yet another barrier, closing above 6000. This came less than 11 months after the market broke 5000, and less than 20 months after it broke 4000.</br></br>Be still, my heart. For despite the hoopla surrounding this pseudo-event, there arc lessons here: some new, some old. The new one is that you snouiun t pay very muc attention to the Dow, which is a crummy measure of the stock market even though everyone uses it, including me. The old lesson is that you shouldn‰Ûªt let any number ending in three zeros determine what you do, no matter what assorted pundits and experts tell you. After all, it‰Ûªs your money, your life, your investment decisions.</br></br>That said, a 6000 Dow raises the same questions people asked when the Dow hit 4000 and 5000. If you're not in the market, is it too late to join the fun? If you‰Ûªre in, should you get out just in case the market has peaked? Will the next thousand-point mark the Dow hits be 7000 or 5000? No one knows, least of all those of us at Newsweek. We‰Ûªre the people who put a bear on the cover 2400 points ago.</br></br>But here‰Ûªs some advice, anyway, before we move on to something more interesting‰ÛÓwhy it‰Ûªs wrong to deify the Dow. Point one: Yes, sooner or later the market will fall sharply, despite stocks having defied history and logic by rising almost continually since October 1990. Point two: For heaven‰Ûªs sake, don‰Ûªt chase hot stocks or hot mutual funds unless you‰Ûªre prepared to lose your shirt. Trend-surfing is fun, but sooner or later, you miss the wave and get wiped. Point three: Please, please, please don‰Ûªt take the Dow too seriously.</br></br>If the Dow hadn't already been around for 100 years, no one would create it now. To be sure, very smart people tend the average and try to keep it up to date. Over the years they've modernized the Dow by leavening its portfolio of heavy industrials with such non-industrials as Coca-Cola Co., Walt Disney Co. and McDonald‰Ûªs Corp. Still, the average‰Ûªs built-in flaws make it subject to weird and random movements. And that brings us to the main and final point. The Dow can tell you which way the market is going, but it's a crude tool. Obsessing about small moves‰ÛÓlike whether 6000 says something that 5900 didn‰Ûªt‰ÛÓis like using a cleaver to perform open-heart surgery."

"Think the stock market is getting boring? After all, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has bobbed along for the past month within a range of less than 2%.</br></br>Don't be fooled. This placid period is, for many analysts, a warning that something big is brewing. But will it be a storm of selling? Or is the market gathering strength for a leap to record highs?</br></br>Robert Robbins, chief market strategist for Robinson Humphrey in Atlanta, likens the stock market to trench warfare. ""You've got a war going between the opposing forces that are the main determinants of stock prices,"" he says. ""Falling interest rates are trying to pull stock prices higher, while a worse-than-expected economic recovery is trying to pull them lower. The net result is that the market is stuck.""</br></br>But Mr. Robbins is betting that the deadlock will soon be broken and that stocks are destined to head higher. ""I will state clearly and emphatically that this market is a strong buy,"" he says, predicting that the Dow Jones Industrial Average will stand at 3200 by year end, and perhaps will reach 4000 by the middle of 1993.</br></br>His logic? Interest rates are in a long-term decline, the rate of which is likely to accelerate. He sees the yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond headed for 7.25% within six months, substantially below the current yield of 7.81%"
"While the short-term risk in the U.S. bond market is that interest rates will rise due to the currency crisis, it's important to remember that the global economic environment is still highly deflationary.</br></br>For five years, the U.S. economy has played the role of global borrower and spender of last resort. Since 1985, Treasury Secretary James Baker has been trying to persuade Europe and Japan to pursue more expansionary policies, but so far they have resisted. Japan has announced numerous supplementary budgets, but then failed to spend the sums promised.</br></br>If the collapse of the dollar now forces the U.S. to introduce a more restrictive mix of monetary and fiscal policies, American domestic demand may not recover from its first quarter slump and the whole world economy could drift toward recession. In fact, the international economic scene is increasingly similar to the period 1928-1933: Growth has ceased in the Southern Hemisphere nations due to a combination of debt crises and falling commodity prices, and stock markets in the Northern Hemisphere have been booming due to surplus liquidity and expansionary monetary policy while real growth has lagged. Now the competitive devaluation policies that characterized the Southern Hemisphere during the first half of the decade are spreading to the Northern Hemisphere: Protectionism is becoming a more acceptable solution to the problem of payment imbalances. The difference between the current period and 1928-1933 is in the roles being played by the major countries.</br></br>In the 1920s, the U.S. was replacing Britain as the world's dominant capital exporter while still adhering to restrictive trade policies. Now Japan is displacing the U.S. as the world's dominant capital exporter while remaining effectively mercantilist in its trading practices.</br></br>Also in the 1920s, Britain was the first major country to slide into recession due to an overvalued exchange rate; in 1931, it devalued its way back into a recovery by abandoning the gold standard while continental Europe and the U.S. remained wedded to monetary orthodoxy. After letting the exchange rate rise sharply during the first half of the decade, the U.S. also is trying to restore its manufacturing sector by devaluing the dollar today."
"Battered by a barrage of attacks from irate consumers, Congress and Democratic presidential candidate Bill Clinton, the highly profitable pharmaceutical industry is headed for leaner times, according to analysts and industry officials.</br></br>With a number of politicians criticizing drug price increases that in the 1980s far exceeded the inflation rate, and increased competition expected from generic manufacturers as patents on many best-selling drugs expire in the next couple of years, analysts are predicting a major shakeout in the industry.</br></br>Some of these forces can be seen at work already. Last week, Syntex Inc., a Palo Alto, Calif., pharmaceutical company, announced layoffs and a restructuring. Its patent on Naprosyn, an arthritis treatment drug that accounts for more than 50 percent of the company's revenue and profit, will expire next year.</br></br>A day earlier, Eli Lilly & Co. of Indianapolis announced its first quarterly loss, $268.5 million. Upjohn Co., which increased earnings by significantly boosting prices in recent years, has had flat earnings this year, and patents on two of its major products - Halcion and Xanax - will run out next year.</br></br>Many industry officials privately predict that a Clinton administration - should the Democratic candidate win - would exert further pressure on their profits.

"Victor Cohn's piece on ""The Disgrace of American Health Care"" {Cover Story, Jan. 24} did not mention a major factor in rising health care costs-the litigious atmosphere in which medicine is practiced today, coupled with astronomical awards in malpractice suits. His ""Dr. Alarmist"" would have a field day ordering tests-perhaps his patients would have benefited, but Dr. A. would then be armed for the almost inevitable confrontation of a malpractice suit.</br></br>Few responsible individuals in medicine, government or the legal profession deny that bad medicine is practiced; but advances in research have led Americans to deny that a ""bad"" result is possible.</br></br>Some states, such as California and Maryland, have already attempted to inject some common sense into the situation by capping ""pain and suffering"" awards, but the legal profession continues to tolerate members who demand settlements beyond believability. Locally, the result has been a sad drain of well qualified physicians to the suburbs, coupled with many simply retiring early and declining to put themselves in situations that can result in suits.</br></br>In your otherwise fine discussion of spiraling health care expenditures, you misuse the word ""inflation,"" which refers to an increase in price unaccompanied by a commensurate increase in quality or quantity of goods or services.</br></br>When a nickel candy bar now costs 45 cents, that's inflation. When you buy a three-bedroom house inside the Beltway for $25,000 in 1960 and sell it for $250,000 today, that's inflation. When a Redskins ticket goes from $6 to $30 in a similar period . . . well, even though they win a few Super Bowls in the meantime, that's mostly inflation, too."
"Author: Mark Gongloff</br></br>Just when markets seemed headed back to normal, the ""risk on/risk off"" trade has come roaring back.</br></br>Across financial markets, trading patterns more commonly seen in 2010 are returning. Stocks and the dollar are consistently moving in opposite directions, as are stocks and Treasury securities.</br></br>It is a trading pattern that was common for much of 2010 as investors swung in and out of markets en masse-buying ""risk on"" investments like stocks when they felt brave, and ""risk off"" assets such as Treasurys and the dollar when they wanted safety.</br></br>That pattern broke down earlier this year, in what some had seen as a return to normalcy. But the tensions in the Middle East and nuclear crisis in Japan have seen it return, frustrating investors who are seeking to trade on fundamental factors instead of headlines. The U.S. and coalition military strikes in Libya that began this weekend could become yet another flashpoint for worry."
"Stock market investors shrugged off the continuing slump in the bond market and bid prices sharply higher.

"THE HUGE AMERICAN trade deficit is still growing, and imports are still rising fast. In January, according to figures just published, this country imported $16.5 billion worth of goods more than it exported‰ÛÓanother melancholy record.

But it‰Ûªs a cumbersome process, and the effects probably won‰Ûªt be visible until the end of this year.</br></br>Economists call it the J-curve, meaning that the deficit gets worse and the line dips down before it turns around and starts upward toward balance. The reason is that the financial markets that set the exchange rates move much faster than the real economy of boxes and bales of goods delivered on the wharf. In general it takes something over a year for the deliveries to be made, the contracts to come up for renegotiation and the importers to find domestic suppliers to replace their increasingly expensive foreign sources.</br></br>1984.

But they're still anxious that investors, already fretting about a possible U.S. recession and skittish about emerging markets, might react to trouble in the two countries by withdrawing their money from other developing nations.</br></br>""What the fund is worried about is they want to localize this stuff because there are other problems out there,"" said Morris Goldstein, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics, a think tank here. Those other problems -- a slowing U.S. economy, high oil prices, stock-market volatility and political turmoil in nations ranging from Peru to Indonesia -- are serious enough without a major developing nation finding itself unable to pay foreign debts, Mr. Goldstein said.</br></br>IMF and U.S. officials say they don't believe the problems have spread yet, although even if they did believe it they would be reluctant to say so aloud for fear of sparking panic.

When I don't play with him 1 might as well have, because without provocation he meticulously describes the lughlights of his game. 1 took a risk and invited him to dinner with the provision that no golf talk be uttered. He responded that of course he could not possibly sit through a whole dinner without discussing the game, but he thought lie would be able to refrain from putting in my living room.</br></br>Owen, a contributing editor of Golf Digest and a staff writer for the New Yorker, probably would not have been able to make even that commitment. He is a member of several country clubs, owns many sets of irons and woods, plays golf in the snow and indulges in practically every other golf-dependent ritual one might imagine, and still others one would never imagine. After playing the great courses of America, Owen writes that he never before could understand the appeal of a monastic life. But now he thought to himself: ""Oh, I get it. Monks feel about God the way I feel about golf. The two words are even almost spelled the same. I suddenly had a vision of a sort of ideal community of golfers: a golfing monastery, or golfastery.‰Û</br></br>Owen writes well and humorously. He writes trenchantly about the questionable moral leadership of the PGA Tour, and he writes exhaustively about all the shots he has hit on the world‰Ûªs most famous courses. As a casual golfer, I care little about whether Ben Hogan and Sam Snead walked on the same fairways I am playing, and I care even less about the shots that Owen played on these fairways.</br></br>One recurrent theme in Owen‰Ûªs book is that his addiction to golf has created certain tensions in his marriage. He writes: ""If golf is, in part, a game of spouse-avoidance, should one wonder that spouses don't like it?"" Despite the appearance that Owen plays golf 80 percent of his waking hours, he repeatedly vents resentment that having a wife and family keeps him from the game, I kept asking myself how he keeps his marriage together. It would have been a true service to"

How can any firm survive such steep losses?</br></br>Using Ford as an example, the answer is that its losses, although huge, have not yet reached a critical point, said David Healy, a Wall Street ana- lyst of the auto industry.

"NEW YORK -- Despite nervousness about falling stock prices, the nation's corporate purchasing managers expect stronger economic growth in 1988 and only a mild increase in inflation.</br></br>Purchasing managers surveyed in mid-November by the National Association of Purchasing Management were ""extremely optimistic"" about the 1988 outlook, said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's business survey committee. This optimism, he said, is fueled by ""significant increases in export business.""</br></br>The purchasing managers sounded more optimistic than most economists in several recent surveys. Many economists fear the stock market's collapse on Oct. 19 will make shoppers more cautious, especially on such major purchases as autos and homes. Some also fear the stock market's woes may persuade companies to postpone capital spending plans until a clearer picture of the economy's health emerges. Nevertheless, most economists still contend there is no evidence of a recession coming anytime soon.</br></br>The consensus in the association's semiannual survey is that this year's fourth quarter will be better than the third. Also, next year's first half is expected to be even stronger than this year's second half.</br></br>The economy's pace is expected to slow in the second half of 1988. Price increases next year will average about 3.6%, up from an estimated 3.2% this year."

It's not a foreclosure, but it doesn't have a functioning kitchen or bathroom. (Nearby, a similar, smaller house in good condition is for sale for $879,000.)</br></br>We think we can get the place for $475,000. Rehabbing it could cost as much as $400,000. But our real estate agent says that we'll have to pay all cash because no one will lend on a house in this condition. Is that true? We only have about $80,000 in cash, but our income and credit are excellent.</br></br>New York City</br></br>A. Your real estate agent is mistaken; you do have financing options. Your best bet is an FHA 203k rehabilitation mortgage. It allows you to roll the purchase price, rehabilitation and closing costs, and even up to six months of mortgage payments (if you don't plan to live in the house during renovation) into one fixed- or adjustable-rate loan.</br></br>However, you won't be able to borrow the entire $875,000 that you estimate it would take to buy and renovate this home. In Brooklyn, according to New York mortgage broker Melanie Crawford, FHA203k mortgages cover up to 96.5% financing of the purchase price and rehabilitation cost, to a base loan amount of $729,750. You can go higher than that if you install energy-efficient improvements, but cannot borrow more than 110% of either the value of the property plus the cost of rehab, or the appraised value of the property after rehab, whichever is less. You'd have to make up any shortfall. (For more rules on this program, see the Housing and Urban Development.)"

"AuthorAffiliation Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</br></br>""I don't buy that it's the beginning of some huge decline. The market is too high -- it's been too high for two years -- but it can stay too high for another two years,"" frets Michael Murphy, who publishes a short-sellers' newsletter called Overpriced Stock Service in Half Moon Bay, Calif.</br></br>There is a reason that the ""shorts,"" who make money when stocks go down instead of up, aren't doing cartwheels over yesterday's move. They have bet heavily starting in early 1994 that the stock market was overheated and due for a major decline. But while the shorts have made profitable bets on certain individual situations -- there are plenty of overhyped stocks out there, after all -- the broader market hasn't plunged this year as they hoped.</br></br>Yesterday's drop in the Dow Jones industrials merely trimmed the year-to-date gain in the Dow to 13.2% from what had been 15.3% through the previous day. That is still a painfully bullish gain to the shorts. Estimates of the shorts' overall declines for the year range from 2% to 10%.</br></br>In fact, many of the active short-sellers are currently locked in to bearish bets that have gotten worse over the months. Shortselling levels on both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market are near records, a total of 2.76 billion shares. If the market shrugs off yesterday's drop and continues its rise, the shorts may have to close out the bets by buying stock at ever-higher levels, a phenomenon that at its worst is known as a ""short squeeze."" It is only then, say some market analysts, that the market will truly be poised for the sustained decline -- perhaps as much as 10% -- that nearly everyone expects."
"Political discourse in modern America usually proceeds on one of two levels -- either slogans (""It's Morning in America""), or specific policies (individual retraining accounts). The vast area between, where slogans are connected to policies and policies are linked to one another, is often the most important but the least discussed. Here is forged a public philosophy.</br></br>Since the end of the Great Society, conservative Republicans have busily been seeding this value-laden terrain. Through countless articles, books, academic studies and conferences, they have concocted a relatively coherent public philosophy. Liberal Democrats, by contrast, have had an abundance of slogans and detailed programs, but they have tended in recent years to ignore the normative vision lying between. As a result, their public philosophy has seemed muddled. This has cost them dearly.</br></br>Robert Lekachman, a professor of economics at City University of New York, understands the importance of a coherent public philosophy and worries that liberals have lost their way. In his ""Visions and Nightmares: America After Reagan"" (Macmillan, 316 pages, $19.95), he sets out the central challenge for America's left -- to articulate principles of equity and social justice, ""and appeal to passions of morality and patriotism that avoid the chauvinism and intrusions into lifestyles of the political right.""</br></br>Mr. Lekachman has two recurring nightmares about American society after Ronald Reagan. The first is that America will slip into a deeper and more prolonged neoconservativism. It will feature the privatization of public services and its corollary, the substitution of vouchers for publicly funded services; the destruction of labor unions and thus a continued downward drift in real wages; in consequence of both, an increasing gulf between the rich and the poor; an enlarged and engorged military; and so on.</br></br>Mr. Lekachman's other nightmare is that ""neoliberals"" will be in charge. He defines them (along with your reviewer) as people who, in contrast to conventional liberals, believe in market solutions and assume social harmony. ""For them, politics seems less group conflict than the search for tax, regulatory, and mild planning initiatives that promote enough growth to soften the harsh edges of ancient struggles between rich and poor, black and white, males and females, the sunbelt and the rust belt."" Neoliberals are individualists, technocrats and yuppies. They come perilously close to being neoconservatives. You wouldn't want them living next door, least of all in power."

"Jasper Becker is Beijing bureau chief for a Hong Kong newspaper, the South China Morning Post, which covers China more extensively than any other English-language paper does. Reporting from China most of the time since 1985, he has been everywhere and asked every question. A few years ago he published a well-regarded book on China's great famine of the 1960s. Now he has pulled together much of his own reporting and that of his Post colleagues to offer a corrective to the outside world's generally sunny view of China today.</br></br>Becker focuses first on poverty-stricken minority peoples living in regions distant from the coast and on peasants in hilly and dry regions. Then he moves chapter by chapter to the cities, and up the ladder from factory workers to private entrepreneurs, bureaucrats and finally the top leaders. As he gets closer to the coast and to Beijing, he brings consumerism and intellectual sophistication into view. He emphasizes how recent China's consumer revolution is, and throws doubt on the argument that the Internet and faxes will pry Chinese society from the grip of the authoritarian state.</br></br>A common view in the West -- and a principle behind the China policies of both Bush pe{grv}re and Bill Clinton -- was that economic opening and growth would improve human rights in China. Becker shows that this optimism has been largely unjustified. Beneath the back- slapping, banqueting and cell-phone networking of private-enterprise China he sees the pathologies of a sick society: unemployment, nepotism, corruption and political repression. Many Chinese are worse off, even though GDP per capita has increased. The welfare system has collapsed, the state enterprises are even hollower than they're commonly understood to be, workers have lost job security, and the traditionally dismal terms of trade between the countryside and the cities have worsened. Private entrepreneurs flourish at the sufferance of the state but fall victim to predatory officials and shifts in government policy, and even on the most optimistic projections cannot create enough jobs to soak up China's surplus labor power. Police repression has tightened: The individual freedoms bruited in the West are restricted to matters of lifestyle, which do not include politics or religion. ""The 600 million Chinese peasants,"" says Becker, ""are the largest unenfranchised group in the world.""</br></br>Becker's reporting is at its best where China is at its worst. Even among specialists, I do not think the collapse of China's health system has been portrayed as incisively as Becker does it here. He is convincing on the sorry state of rural education, although I think he underestimates strengths at the university level, and he is scathing and correct on the often overpraised reforms of the justice system.</br></br>Some details Becker gets wrong. It's not fair to say that ""China has annexed the South China Sea"" or that ""China acts as if it has no international obligations other than to ethnic Chinese."" It's not true that the National People's Congress has no permanent staff or offices or that Deng Xiaoping had no official post in 1989 except chairman of the Chinese Bridge Association (in fact, Deng's chairmanship of the Central Military Commission was crucial to his role in the events of that year). The prediction that Taiwan will help fund the Chinese democracy movement and hence determine China's future strikes me as misguided in two ways -- because the Taiwanese avoid involvement in mainland politics, and because change is more likely to come from within the ruling Communist Party than from the dissident movement."

"Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>The shift away from defined-benefit plans is putting more responsibility on workers to pad their own nest eggs, but so far, at least one-fifth of new retirees appears to be faltering under the burden.</br></br>This finding, from a report released last week by the nonpartisan Employee Benefit Research Institute, comes at a time when President Bush is pushing to allow workers to divert a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes into private accounts, making investors even more accountable for their retirement savings.</br></br>Employers, in recent years, have stepped up their efforts to get workers into 401(k) plans amid the changing retirement-plan landscape and the uncertainty of Social Security. Still, nearly a third of eligible workers aren't participating in their company's 401(k) plan, and of those who do, many aren't putting away enough to make it through their retirement years, according to Hewitt Associates, a global outsourcing and consulting firm in Lincolnshire, Ill.</br></br>These savings patterns, if they don't change, will wreak havoc on nest eggs. Already, among 15% of new retirees -- many of whom had defined-benefit plans for at least part of their career -- total wealth fell by at least 50% from 1992 to 2002. An even greater number, about a fifth, of this group are in danger of running out of money during retirement. Still, the majority of those born in 1931 to 1941, individuals who are now 64 to 74 years old, saw their total wealth grow by 50% or more during this 10-year period."
"LONDON -- Britain's Conservative Party Government, backing off from earlier plans to stimulate the economy with tax cuts equivalent to as much as $3.4 billion, outlined a fiscal 1986 budget with little new spending and only $850 million in tax reductions.</br></br>""Government can't create jobs, only businesses can,"" Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.</br></br>Still, the budget for the year starting April 1 should allow Britain's economy to grow 3% this calendar year, up from last year's growth of 2 1/2%, Mr. Lawson said. The budget aims to help the economy by offering more belt-tightening to shrink the deficit, shore up the pound and fight inflation.</br></br>The British budget is part of a broader European pattern of financial austerity. France, West Germany and Italy also are committed to narrowing their budget deficits, and all four governments acknowledge they are trying to reverse years of rising state spending.</br></br>Mr. Lawson rebuked the U.S. for ""importing a large part of the rest of the world's savings, and exporting some of its own inflation. This isn't a sustainable situation,"" the chancellor said."
"The Republican party has a powerful new superhero. But Arnold Schwarzenegger's surprisingly strong victory in California also flashes some warning signs for President Bush and his party.</br></br>Mr. Schwarzenegger ousted Democratic Gov. Gray Davis with ease and cut deeply into Democrats' traditional union and Hispanic base. He brings the Republicans a star quality that recalls another former actor and California governor, Ronald Reagan. And Mr. Schwarzenegger represents an instant asset in the nation's largest state as Mr. Bush gears up for his re-election campaign.</br></br>Yet Mr. Schwarzenegger prevailed by stoking voters' frustration with those in power and the desire to oust them -- troubling sentiments for Republicans who control all levers of power at the national level. The California revolt began with a failure to resolve a big budget deficit, one of the problems at the top of Mr. Bush's list of woes. And Mr. Schwarzenegger's broad appeal came in part from his moderate stands on abortion, gay rights and gun control -- positions sure to set off nasty fights at any national Republican gathering.</br></br>Moreover, Mr. Schwarzenegger's campaign offered no real clue about how he will deal with his most pressing problem: keeping his promises to cut an unpopular auto tax, raise no other new taxes, increase education spending and somehow close California's yawning deficit all at the same time. With the intense national spotlight that now shines on the Golden State, Republicans badly need him to succeed.</br></br>Mr. Schwarzenegger didn't flesh out his plans in any more detail in his first postelection news conference yesterday afternoon. He reiterated his campaign-trail vow that ""I will not raise taxes."" But he also said he'd just learned that the state's budget deficit may turn out to be $20 billion rather than the previous estimate of $8 billion, though the reason he alluded to -- a pending legal action to halt the sale of some state bonds -- has been well-known to state officials and observers for some time. He said only that he'll arrange an independent audit of state government's books and then work with the Democratic-controlled Legislature to close the gap."

"A VEHEMENT and portentous dispute over inflation is now under way, quite openly, within the administration. The issue is being forced by Americans‰Ûª gradual comprehension of the enormous damage that prolonged inflation would inflict on our country. Over the past generation we have built strong and generally successful protections against high unemployment. But inflation, at the present extraordinary level, is an unfamiliar menace to Americans and in the highest councils of our government there is no agreement where it is going or how it can be controlled.</br></br>It is 'conspicuous that, within the administration, the most optimistic views belong to those people who are &iot economists‰ÛÓfor example, President Nixon and White House aide Ronald Ziegler. In the spectrum of official opinion, the degree of pessimism seems to rise in proportion to intellectual stature and professional standing. One of the best-qualified students of the current inflation, Dr. John Dunlop, the director of the Cost of Living Council, has concluded that after a midyear dip the inflation rate will actually be rising by the end of the year. The most eminent economist in Washington is the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Dr. Arthur Burns, who is now invoking dire and dramatic terms to describe the costs to our society that a long inflation promises. It is worth noting the precise words that these men are using.</br></br>The President sees, as usual, only sunshine ahead. Even before he came under the threat of impeachment, he had great difficulty delivering bad news and this failing‰ÛÓa grave one in a national leader‰ÛÓis becoming more pronounced. ‰ÛÏI am confident that we will experience further improvements in the economy during the remainder of this year.‰Û he said in his radio speech last weekend. ‰ÛÏWe expect the inflation rate to be significantly lower than the rate we have experienced in the past 18 months.‰Û In contrast, the chairman of his Council of Economic Advisers, Dr. Herbert Stein, offers a far more cautious and somber forecast. The Council, in its midyear review published Tuesday, moved away from the precise numerical predictions of its Economic Report four months earlier, with its unqualified assurances of a decline in the inflation rate. Instead, the Council wrote, . a fall in the rate of inflation in the food and energy sectors will reduce the overall rate of inflation. significantly but will still leave a stubborn inflationary; process under way in the rest of the economy. ... The basic problem will be to prevent the slowing trend that does occur from being reversed . . Dr. Stein has been, over the years, a kind of cheerleader for the White House but he is, after all, a trained economist.</br></br>Where Dr. Stein foresees the inflationary process ‰ÛÏunderway,‰Û Dr. Dunlop expects ‰ÛÏan upturn in the general,rate of inflation‰Û toward the end of the year. Dr. Burns, in a remarkable warning delivered a week ago, declared: ‰ÛÏThe gravity of our current inflationary probleqi can hardly be overestimated ... I do not believe I exaggerate in saying that the ultimate consequence of inflation could well be a significant decline of economic and political freedom for the American people.‰Û</br></br>Since there is no agreement within the administration regarding the future course of the inflation, it is hardly surprising that there is also no agreement about the remedy. The President seems to think that we do not need much of a remedy, since he assumes that the food and oil shortages are over and things will get better by themselves. The number of people who believe that is getting steadily smaller. Suppose, instead, that we take the matter as seriously as Dr. Dunlop and Dr. Burns think we should. They do not have an easy good cheer to offer us. Both have been quite explicit about remedies, and their prescriptions all run to profound structural changes in the way that we regard money and spend it‰ÛÓnot only as a government but as businesses and consumers. But structural reforms require a great deal of time."
"MEMO TO EMPLOYERS: Guess who's starting to call the shots again?</br></br>As the economy shows signs of a nascent recovery, some job seekers are taking an increasingly bold -- and sometimes manipulative -- approach to finding work. Disillusioned by the sweeping layoffs and corporate penny-pinching of the past 18 months, they are employing tactics typically reserved for more robust times, such as accepting two job offers at once and then playing one prospective employer off against the other. Some keep searching for jobs after starting a new post and then jump ship when they find something better. Others, meantime, are holding two good positions at one time, a split of loyalties they hope might blunt the blow of future layoffs.</br></br>After 10 frustrating months of unemployment, Sandra Gesburg accepted a sales representative job in early February at Advanced Toxicology Network, a Memphis, Tenn., laboratory that provides workplace drug testing. But just three weeks later, she was offered a better position and 25% salary increase from Professional Resources Screening Inc., a Concord, Calif., provider of pre-employment screening. Although the company had turned her down for a job once before, that was no matter -- 48-year-old Ms. Gesburg immediately took the post. ""They made me an offer I couldn't refuse,"" she says matter-of-factly.</br></br>Stuart Bogema, Ms. Gesburg's old boss and ATN's chief executive, says he wasn't ""too happy"" with Ms. Gesburg's quick departure. ""She hadn't even worked long enough for us to see if she was going to be an able employee or not,"" says Dr. Bogema. ""When someone leaves after only a few weeks, that level of trust disappears.""</br></br>The attitude shift among employees comes after months of turbulent times. Companies from Cisco and Lucent to WorldCom have slashed thousands of jobs since early 2001. Others have re-assigned employees at random, delayed start dates and forced job seekers to jump through all sorts of hoops before extending an offer. More recently, the scandals at Enron Corp. and Arthur Andersen, which have cost thousands their jobs and retirement savings, have intensified employee cynicism -- and validated their efforts to look after themselves."

"I recently had the privilege of working closely with two men of uncommon courage -- Andrew F. Brimmer, former chair of the D.C. financial control board, and Julius W. Becton Jr., former chief executive officer and superintendent of the D.C. public schools.</br></br>Before taking up their work in the District, these men had climbed the heights of their chosen professions. Brimmer was one of the leading economists in the United States and a member of the Federal Reserve Board. Becton had retired, after 40 years of service, as a U.S. Army lieutenant general. Both Brimmer and Becton are members of what Thomas Jefferson called that ""natural aristocracy,"" based not upon birth but upon ""virtue and talents.""</br></br>Brimmer and Becton volunteered for arduous and time-consuming positions in our community in a time of troubles. They did this not for recognition, of which each already had received a full measure, but because they hoped to make a difference. And they did make a difference.</br></br>Brimmer helped put the District on the road to recovery and reform. Changing the city's course was like turning a battleship in a storm, but his firm hand on the helm managed to bring the ship around. Likewise, Becton laid the groundwork for a better school system, which he left to the control of his chosen successor, Arlene Ackerman.</br></br>The Bible says that a prophet is not without honor, save in his own country. Although neither Becton nor Brimmer would claim the mantle of prophet, each in his own way blazed a trail for others to follow toward a better future for the District. As the Bible also says, men such as these are ""the glory of their times."" They need no defense from me."
"Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>It all seems so simple.</br></br>The dollar weakens, U.S. goods and services become more competitive in world markets, imports slow as consumers balk at higher prices and the current-account deficit shrinks to a more manageable -- and, for policy makers, a less scary -- level.</br></br>This domino theory, though, plays down one very important practical point: The pain a weaker dollar inflicts elsewhere and the subsequent discomfort that makes politicians squirm. So as the dollar slide has accelerated in recent weeks, the regional battle lines have begun to be drawn.</br></br>That has been evident in the rising chorus of complaints from U.S. trade partners about the falling dollar. In the year ahead, economists believe relations could chill even further, with some suggesting the dollar's adjustment could spark real trade tensions."
"The Concord Coalition recently released its ‰ÛÏZero Deficit Plan,‰Û which proposes to eliminate the federal budget deficit by the year 2000. The plan‰Ûªs sponsors, former Democratic senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts and Republican Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, also unveiled a ""Debt Clock,"" mounted on a trailer, to be hauled around the country for photo-ops to underscore the peril of the rising national debt.</br></br>The coalition was intended to be a grass-roots group, sounding a national alarm in the spirit of Paul Revere (""The deficit is here!‰Û)‰ÛÓhence the name Concord Coalition. It is an epic case of well-meaning people pursuing a perverse goal.</br></br>For one thing, the deficit is already on a downward course. With the 1993 budget accord in place, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office now forecasts that the deficit will gradually decline from its present level of 4.3 percent of gross domestic product to 2.5 percent of GDP by 1998.</br></br>At that level, the national debt begins shrinking relative to the growth of the real economy. In other words, the great deficit crisis is basically over.</br></br>If you think investors are deterred by the fear of rising deficits, ‰ÛÏcrowding-out‰Û of private investments by government borrowing or renewed inflation, please explain why they are lending money to the Treasury for 30 years at a fixed interest rate of 6 percent. The fact that interest rates have been declining for three straight years suggests that deficits are a much-exaggerated peril."

"I am sick of everyone blaming the breakdown in the credit and housing markets on subprime loans. Subprime loans were certainly part of the problem, but they are a symptom of a deeper issue. What's happening in the market today is not the bursting of a five-year bubble but the bursting of a 40-year bubble and the failure of the mortgage loan system to meet the needs of the marketplace.</br></br>The truth is that subprime lenders, by responding to demand, were the finger in the dike for the whole housing market. The real problem is affordability and the incongruity between incomes and home pricing.</br></br>Forty years ago, the median national price of a house was about twice the median household income. In some parts of the country, this ratio was closer to 1 to 1. Twenty years ago, the median home price was about three times income. In the past 10 years, it jumped to four times income.</br></br>But in most major economic centers, typical families haven't been able to buy a home for anything near the national median price for decades. Try to find a single-family home in the D.C. area for the national median of $221,900. In the major markets, there is tremendous dependency on alternatives to the standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, which in turn has created a dependency on the least scrupulous mortgage companies and lenders.</br></br>The issue of affordability is not news to the major players in real estate. Each month, lenders, developers and government agencies study the National Association of Realtors' Housing Affordability Index. This index provides a way to track whether housing is becoming more or less affordable for typical households nationwide; it incorporates changes in key variables such as home prices, interest rates and incomes."

The broader market did a bit better, but with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gaining 3%, it, too, drew yawns rather than applause.</br></br>But even as the market treaded water, corporate profits grew quickly. Company analysts polled by Reuters Estimates predict that earnings for companies in the S&P 500 increased 13.6% in 2005.

In fact, it's the lowest S&P 500 P/E ratio in 10 years."

"The outlook for business investment appears to be improving, but business spending is still likely to be weak through the end of this year.</br></br>The G7 Group Inc., a closely held political and economic consulting firm, said the latest preliminary reading of its quarterly index of business investment improved to a minus 25 in the fourth quarter from minus 37 in the third quarter.</br></br>An index measure of minus 33 or lower suggests that business fixed investment is contracting in the current quarter. An index reading between zero and minus 33 indicates growth, but at slower rates than the historical average of 5%. Results greater than zero indicate above-average business investment.</br></br>More specifically, the minus 25 reading is consistent with a 1.1% increase in business investment in the fourth quarter on a seasonally adjusted, annualized basis, G7 Group said.</br></br>If business investment does grow at a 1.1% annual rate this quarter, it would be a step up from the third quarter, when capital spending increased at a 0.6% annual rate, the first gain in two years.

"MANY HOMEOWNERS with adjustable-rate mortgages are nearing the day when their interest rate gets its first adjustment. Those facing a payment increase likely will be double-checking their lenders' math just to make sure they won't be paying a cent more than they are required.</br></br>But owners whose interest rates are tied to Treasury securities' rates might be puzzled if they try to figure out just how lenders compute their new rates. Typically, these mortgages will be adjusted to a rate that's a percentage point or two above the rate for a one-year or three-year Treasury bill index.</br></br>The trouble seems to be finding out what the index figures are. Many assumed they could simply turn to the appropriate yield figures for Treasury bills published in this newspaper and others. Not so.</br></br>The correct source is the Treasury constant maturities index, and the Federal Reserve System is believed to be the only one that publishes it. This index is a theoretical construct that computes what the yield would be on Treasury securities if issued during that period. Consequently, the index isn't identical to any real security.</br></br>Why was such an obscure index chosen? For one thing, it's difficult to base the rates on actual new issues of Treasury securities because they are auctioned intermittently. In addition, lenders say the constant maturity index is the fairest reflection of the cost of money."
"Lawmakers left an extension of jobless benefits out of their budget agreement, fueling the debate over what happens to unemployed workers--and the economy--when the program expires.</br></br>Many Democrats are upset that the extension wasn't included in the deal, and the White House estimates that roughly 1.3 million workers will stop receiving unemployment payments, which average $300 a week, when the program expires on Dec. 28. Republicans say the extended benefits have gone on long enough--more than five years--and argue that the checks create a disincentive for people to find work.</br></br>Many economists believe such aid boosts the unemployment rate, perhaps by as much as 1 percentage point. But they differ on the reasons and on the size of the effect. Some of the unemployed might drop out of the labor force altogether without the aid; others might be spurred to search harder for a job.</br></br>Now the debate is about whether current economic circumstances warrant a longer extension. Democrats argue that they do and that the current labor market is too weak to allow benefits to expire. About 4.1 million workers in the U.S. have been jobless for at least six months. That is down from a peak of 6.7 million in April 2010, but still triple the pre-recession level.</br></br>""Although [long-term unemployment] has come down, it is still at an unusually high level by historical standards,"" said Rob Valletta, economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. ""That raises concern about the status of the long-term unemployed and policies that might be designed to support them."""

"In place of the ""power ties"" of the Reagan years, Washington men are now wearing neckties that look like walls of Play-Doh oozing through a chain-link fence. Ties that look like amoebas marching across the Hawaiian flag, like a pool table dressed up as a rain forest, like a squadron of Chiclets lost in space, like the colorblindness test that kept your Uncle Lou out of the Army.</br></br>You see them all over downtown Washington, laid out in the paneled eternity of Britches at $50-or-so apiece. Or hung out by street vendors in three-for-$10 clusters so thick you could use them as automatic carwash brushes. Even at Brothers, where next to the tiny pheasants there's an apocalyptic paisley.</br></br>Just a few years ago, these neckties were not only out of fashion, not only bad taste, they were reactionary relics of the 1940s, like Filipinos standing in dime-store windows demonstrating yo-yos. And power ties were the fixed and final style for the Connecticut Avenue Commandos, the Gucci Gang, the K Street Torpedoes.</br></br>""Power ties started in Washington,"" says Gerald Anderson, head of the Neckwear Association of America. They were little prints (called ""neats""), often on a yellow background, the sort of thing you might reupholster a chair with if the Queen of England were coming to visit. Or polka dots, transcendently genteel in their tininess, as if someone had fired holes in the tie with a shotgun loaded with dust. There was something irreducible about them, the distillation of male respectability to a Zenlike potency.</br></br>It started with the trend-surfers, the retro freaks, the thrift- shop mavens. They were the first to spot the styles of the '40s and '50s as a growth stock. Soon you saw these ties on hip waiters and art gallery assistants, on men who spent a lot of time in New York or Los Angeles, which were places that had never treated the power tie as some kind of bias-cut Shroud of Turin."
"WASHINGTON -- The administration and the Federal Reserve have cited a ""credit crunch"" as one of the main reasons the U.S. economy is in recession. The following questions and answers attempt to explain this troublesome phenomenon.</br></br>What is the credit crunch?</br></br>Simply put, it is the widespread reluctance of banks to lend to borrowers to whom they would have lent eagerly in the past. Because banks play a central role in financing economic growth, the credit crunch has broad effects on the U.S. economy. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan says it has ""very little historic precedent.""</br></br>What caused it?</br></br>With more and more loans going sour, the economy weakening and real estate values falling, bankers have grown more cautious. The memories of the excesses and financial failures of the 1980s are crimping lending in the 1990s. In addition, new rules, or capital standards, require many banks to either raise more capital from investors or make fewer loans. Unable or unwilling to raise capital, many banks are pulling back on lending."
"Joliet, Ill. -- In this blue-collar city, both political parties will spend the fall vying for the attention and affection of citizens like Carol Rapcan.</br></br>They will have to take a number and stand in line.</br></br>Even as the presidential sex scandal fills the front pages, Ms. Rapcan says lots of things are more important to her life than national politics. At age 55, she devotes much energy to her three daughters. She is also focused on the good economy. A busy bridal-shop owner is practically begging her to come and do alterations. At her regular job -- working the gift shop at Harrah's casino in town -- Ms. Rapcan watches as more and more people line up to spend their extra cash.</br></br>And in the past couple of years, something else has grabbed her by the heart: ""Religion and the Lord,"" Ms. Rapcan says, clasping her hands together. Twice a week, she drives more than an hour to church. Last week, the sermon was on forgiveness. The week before, it was about seeing the good in everyone. Ms. Rapcan says she gets a lot more out of those messages than out of anything politicians can do for her.</br></br>Apparently, she is one of many who place politics far down on the list of things that influence their lives. In the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, the bulk, or 48% of people surveyed, say developments in medicine and health care affect their lives a ""great deal."" About 46% feel the nation's moral values affect their lives a lot. And as the stock market dives and soars, 33% say the market and conditions of the country have a big personal impact."
"As oil flirted with $100 and credit markets continued to roil, stock indexes tumbled -- and tongues wagged.</br></br>Crude-oil futures stayed below the century mark today, settling 33 cents lower at $96.37. But they drove above $98 earlier in the day after a weekly government report on oil inventories showed a decline, albeit a smaller one than expected. U.S. inventories fell by 800,000 barrels; analysts surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected a number about twice as large. In recent months, oil futures had approached and then vaulted over $90, making a march on $100 oil look inexorable. U.S. stocks plummeted on crude's gains today, although equities had often shrugged off recent crude rallies. The Dow fell 360.92 points, or 2.6%, to 13300.02, and the Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell even more on a percentage basis, losing 2.7% and 2.9%, respectively. European markets closed mostly lower, while Asian indexes were mixed. Bonds rallied. More rumblings in the credit markets also contributed to equities' slide: Moody's downgraded about $36 billion in debt securities held in so-called structured investment vehicles, and analysts at Royal Bank of Scotland Group said banks and brokers could face as much as $100 billion in write-downs on various exotic, illiquid holdings. Adding to the angst was the U.S. dollar. The greenback continued its downward spiral -- first on bearish remarks from a Chinese political official, and then on pressure from crude prices and the expectation that U.S. interest rates would stay below rates elsewhere. The euro peaked earlier at $1.4371. The British pound hit $2.1070, the first time it has broken $2.10 since 1981.</br></br>Stock indexes weren't alone in reacting to the oily mess. ""Energy prices are entirely too high, and really affecting small businesses and families all across America, not to mention our economy,"" White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Wednesday. Ms. Perino also said the Bush administration hoped lawmakers would soon move a bill that aims to cut U.S. dependence on foreign oil and boost domestic energy sources. Meanwhile, Fed governor Kevin Warsh said that oil and commodity prices were likely to put upward pressure on overall inflation in the short term. ""There are . . . important reasons to be concerned about the outlook for inflation,"" he said today in an address to the New York Association for Business Economics. ""Although recent readings on core inflation have been favorable, prices of crude oil and other commodities have increased. These changes most likely will put upward pressure on overall inflation in the short run."" Mr. Warsh also said the weakening dollar could lead to higher prices for imported goods. ""If these same forces cause inflation expectations to become less reliably anchored, then inflation could increase in the longer run as well."" Separately, St. Louis Fed President William Poole warned today in a speech that ""excessive"" rate reductions would run the risk of fanning inflation and spurring market volatility. Since the summer, the Fed already has cut short-term interest rates twice as an antidote to the ills of the housing slump and the credit crunch. But the Fed last week released a policy statement that appeared to close the door on further cuts in the near future even as the economy appears to be downshifting.</br></br>---</br></br>Red Ink at GM, Black at Toyota"

Fortunately, Americans have evidence that will allow them not only to judge President Obama's economic performance, but also to compare that performance with Mr. Romney's proposed alternative.</br></br>Twice in postwar America, deep recessions have driven the unemployment rate to 10%. In the 1981-82 recession, the unemployment rate soared to 10.8%. In the 2007-09 recession, it peaked at 10%.</br></br>Both downturns were rooted in financial convulsions. The 1981-82 recession was induced by restrictive monetary policy aimed at breaking the back of double-digit inflation and interest rates, which generated a housing and savings-and-loan crisis. The more recent recession resulted from excessive government intervention to increase homeownership by expanding subprime housing loans, on which substantial leverage was built. The resulting wave of defaults damaged the base of the banking system.</br></br>Fifty-three months after the start of the 1981-82 recession, total employment in the U.S. was up 7.5 million, or almost 7.5% higher than when the recession began. The labor-force participation rate rose to 65% from 63.8%, as optimism about the future pulled potential workers into the job market. Real per capita gross domestic product increased by $2,870 and was 11% higher than when the recession started.</br></br>Fifty-three months after the start of the 2007-09 recession, however, total employment in the U.S. is still down four million jobs, or 2.7% lower than when the recession began. The labor-force participation rate has dropped to 63.8% from 66%, as discouraged workers have exited the labor market. Real per capita GDP has declined by $964 and is 2.2% lower today than when the recession began."

"HONG KONG--The U.S. unemployment rate should fall below 6% by the end of 2014, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said Wednesday at an investor conference in Hong Kong.</br></br>Mr. Bullard, a member of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, said the U.S. economy is improving and unemployment had fallen much more quickly than many people expected.</br></br>The Fed had previously committed to keeping short-term rates low well past the time when the unemployment rate fell below 6.5%, especially if inflation remained below 2%. The unemployment rate stood at 6.7% in February, while inflation has failed to rise significantly and economic growth remains fragile.</br></br>That pushed the Fed at its policy meeting last week to drop reference in its regular statement to the unemployment threshold. Instead, the statement said rates will stay low for a considerable time after the Fed's bond-buying program ends.</br></br>Mr. Bullard, speaking at a conference organized by Credit Suisse, said the FOMC from now on would use ""more standard"" and ""qualitative"" language rather than relying on quantitative thresholds to guide market expectations of future rate decisions."
"There evidently was a failure to communicate in my interview with your reporter on drug prices (""Harsh Medicine: Attack on Drug Prices Opens Clinton's Fight for Health-Care Plan,"" page one, Feb. 16). I am quoted as saying that the pharmaceutical industry ""deserved"" the wrath of the current administration. I merely meant that the industry should have seen some such wrath coming. To see a hurricane coming, of course, does not mean one ""deserves"" it. It merely means one should be prepared for it.</br></br>In more than 20 years of teaching economics and finance at Princeton I have consistently offered my students the following normative proposition: In a capitalist society, the explicitly stated social responsibility of investor-owned entities is to maximize their owners' wealth without violating the laws of the land. It can be said that the investor-owned pharmaceutical industry has legitimately owned up to that mandate during the past decade. At the same time, it can also be said that the social fallout from that policy has raised legitimate political concerns. That is part and parcel of a democracy.</br></br>It is true that spending on pharmaceutical products represents only 7% to 8% of total national health spending. It is also true that total annual spending on medicine typically lags behind total annual consumer spending on alcohol and tobacco. But as early as 1982 I sought to alert executives of the industry to the fact that spending on their products represents a huge hit on the budgets of low-income, chronically ill people who typically lack insurance for prescription drugs, and that sooner or later this fiscal distress would trigger legitimate concerns among politicians.</br></br>Throughout the 1980s I urged members of the industry to recover their huge overhead costs mainly from middle- and upper-income households, and not from chronically ill poor people. That could have been achieved either by urging on Congress coverage for medicine for all low-income people (a strategy used in other countries) or through some analogue of food stamps, a special discount credit card or some other price-discriminatory device. I recall that idea being laughed off as ""Ivy League socialism"" during the heady 1980s. In retrospect, it may appear as good politico-economic advice.</br></br>The industry's failure to deal with these political pressures pre-emptively does not ""deserve"" punishment. But it is a strategic error nevertheless. Perhaps there is still time to develop with government a constructive compromise between compassion and the fiscal needs of the industry. Uwe E.

"Agricultural researchers at the University of Missouri at Columbia's Center for Agroforestry are experimenting with more than 50 varieties of chestnuts. The goal: to bring back the American chestnut.</br></br>A century ago -- before an Asian blight devastated most of the country's millions of chestnut trees -- chestnuts were a staple of American diets, particularly for recent immigrants. The trees' rot- resistant timber was used to build barns and beams, its bark provided tannin for leather.</br></br>While the chestnut remains an oddity for most Americans, commercial production is increasing, and so is demand.</br></br>""The American Chestnut Foundation has worked very closely with the Agriculture Department to come up with a disease-resistant strain of the American chestnut,"" President Bush said when he planted a 16-foot chestnut tree on the White House grounds to mark the 133rd annual celebration of Arbor Day on April 29. ""One day the American chestnut . . . will be coming back. And this is our little part to help it come back.""</br></br>For now, domestic production is a fraction of the global market, said Michael Gold, associate director of the Missouri center. He estimates that U.S. chestnut growers produced 1.5 million pounds last year, compared with 200 million pounds worldwide."

"CHICAGO -- An improving job market is prompting Mitt Romney to scrap his emphasis on the unemployment rate and to focus on rising gas prices and government regulation as evidence that President Barack Obama has mismanaged the economy.</br></br>""With the economy looking like it's getting a little better on the employment front, gasoline's getting a lot worse,"" Mr. Romney told a crowd at a town-hall meeting Sunday in Vernon Hills, Ill.</br></br>At the University of Chicago on Monday, Mr. Romney argued that government regulation under Mr. Obama threatens to strangle ground-breaking ideas and would have stopped the work of Thomas Edison and the Wright brothers.</br></br>Mr. Romney has built his campaign on the premise he is better-equipped than Mr. Obama or any of the other Republicans seeking the presidential nomination to reinvigorate the economy.</br></br>The new approach in Mr. Romney's attacks came on the cusp of a primary election on Tuesday in Illinois that has the potential to boost his lead over other GOP candidates in the delegate count. The few polls conducted recently show Mr. Romney leading his closest rival, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, by between four and 15 percentage points. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Texas Rep. Ron Paul have campaigned little in the state and trail in opinion surveys."

There were no order cancellations, he says, and the company picked up a $1.7 million order from an auto manufacturer, along with several smaller ones.</br></br>Early indications are that last week's stock market crash so far has had little direct impact on capital spending decisions by the nation's businesses. However, if the market drop causes a consumer-led economic slowdown, corporate investment would drop some months from now, capital goods producers say.</br></br>Machine tool builders reported a 35% rise in September orders from weak year-earlier levels. And industry executives say business continues to be relatively good this month. September orders at domestic machine tool plants totaled $183.2 million, up from $135.3 million a year earlier, the National Machine Tool Builders' Association reported. That was a gain of 29% from August, but August traditionally is a weak order month because many decision makers are on vacation."
"NOW VIRGINIA can truly call itself the ""Old Dominion."" Famous for its legions of retired federal and military pensioners, Virginia looks to be America's next Sun City. Thanks to a bill signed last summer by Gov. George Allen, his state can lay claim to the nation's most senior-friendly tax policy.</br></br>What's happening in Virginia should remind victorious Republicans that both political parties are responsible for the pandering to seniors that contributes mightily to America's fiscal crisis. It should also remind the Kerrey-Danforth ""Commission on Entitlements and Tax Reform"" to pay due attention to the word ""tax"" as they prepare their report. In recent decades, all levels of government have given tax advantages to well-off seniors while ignoring the extra burden this age bias imposes on younger generations.</br></br>Although many states, as well as the federal government, show favoritism to older people in their tax laws, Virginia's new law pushes this bias to a new extreme. The law offers no new benefits to seniors with incomes below the poverty line but gives handsome rewards to middle- and upper-income retirees. The bottom line is this: Every senior, no matter how rich, gets an extra $12,000 annual deduction on the state income tax form that young taxpayers don't - plus a total exclusion on social security income.</br></br>This means that, starting in 1996, a retired 65-year-old couple on maximum social security (projected at $13,764 per retiree) will pay no state income tax on their first $59,728 of income - regardless of how the rest of their income is derived. A 62-year-old couple will pay nothing on the first $40,622 of income. But a 30-year-old couple with one child will pay tax on income above $7,400.</br></br>To this new break, Fairfax County's seniors can also add the ""empty-nester"" total property tax forgiveness for middle-income seniors with incomes up to $40,000 and assets (excluding residence) of up to $150,000. Now add federal income and FICA taxes to the calculations, and look what happens in the following cases:"

"As they prepare their year-end predictions, economic forecasters must struggle with an unpleasant reality: Nobody thanks them for correctly predicting bad news.</br></br>Economist Rosanne M. Cahn, for example, remembers how odd it felt to be elated over the economy's sluggishness in early 1993 after a strong end of 1992. She was happy because she had predicted the slowdown correctly. As a director in the economics department of CS First Boston Corp., she had advised clients to expect exactly that pattern because of heavy late 1992 spending caused by Hurricane Andrew and early payment of bonuses to avoid expected tax increases in 1993.</br></br>Business Week hailed her as ""the savviest soothsayer of all,"" and colleagues sent congratulatory notes. Despite some guilt feelings, Cahn decided to enjoy it. ""You realize that your happiness is at the expense of someone else's job,"" she said. But for a forecaster, that's life.</br></br>Sometimes being a forecaster makes you feel as if you ""don't have any friends left in the world, but that is just part of the reality of the job,"" said Stephen S. Roach, co-director of global economics at Morgan Stanley & Co.</br></br>The nation's prognosticators don't see anything catastrophic ahead in 1995. Most agree that this year's booming 4 percent growth in the nation's gross domestic product cannot be sustained, but many predict a solid 3 percent gain. (Cahn is more pessimistic at 2.5 percent.)"

"BUENOS AIRES -- Four months after Brazil's devaluation, Argentina's recession drags on as companies struggle with high costs and a U.S. dollar-pegged exchange-rate system that many believe is still essential to economic stability.</br></br>Despite weakened currencies in just about every major Latin American economy in the past five years, Argentina has hung on doggedly to its link to the dollar. The so-called Convertibility Plan, in which the dollar peg plays a key part, extinguished Argentine inflation and provided a base of stability that allowed the economy to grow at an average annual rate of 5.8% between 1991 and 1998. But because the dollar peg means Argentina can't weaken its currency to make its exports more competitive, it has to find ways to lower the cost of production.</br></br>Economists say the government hasn't complemented the currency system with policies that lower costs for businesses, and that may be delaying economic recovery. ""If the government is going to say that convertibility is a sacred cow, they have to build competitiveness,"" says Pedro Lacoste, whose Buenos Aires economic-research firm bears his name. ""It's a tough agenda with powerful interests against it. But whoever the next finance minister is, he better be very convinced about these issues.""</br></br>In the early 1990s, Argentina increased competitiveness, Mr. Lacoste says, by slashing export taxes and liberalizing port regulations. But the government's attention now seems to be diverted by political shadow plays in a presidential election year. Some new tax policies appear to be working against competitiveness. In an announcement of default yesterday, power generator Central Termica Guemes SA said it wouldn't make a $3.6 million interest payment in part because of ""new taxes levied by the Argentine government on assets and on cash interest payments.""</br></br>Mr. Lacoste estimates that gross domestic product will fall 3% this year, while exports decline around 12%. Yesterday, the government said auto production fell 51% in April from the same month a year earlier; electricity consumption fell 9% in the same period. ""The government and some economists were betting on a recovery in the second quarter; it is just not happening yet,"" says Martin Lousteau, an economist who works with Mr. Lacoste."

"The attacks by Nation of Islam spokesman Khalid Abdul Muhammad on Jews and by local radio personality Cathy Hughes on Hispanics occurred at different times and in different places and, on the surface, are completely unrelated.</br></br>But defenders of both tirades have used similar twisted logic in justifying the attacks. Boiled down, their reasoning goes like this: Attacking an entire group of people is justified not necessarily because the targets are worthy of being excoriated but because the verbal assaults are a vehicle for inspiring blacks to help themselves.</br></br>At Kean College in New Jersey late last year, Muhammad called Jews ""the bloodsuckers of the black nation,"" and said they control the Federal Reserve and the White House. He said Jews are known by such names as Rubenstein, Silverstein and Goldstein because they hoard rubies, silver and gold. Muhammad was later stripped of his position with the Nation of Islam by Minister Louis Farrakhan, who nonetheless said he basically agreed with what Muhammad said.</br></br>On Jan. 26, Hughes, speaking to listeners of her WOL-AM radio station, said Hispanics have ""taken over"" parts of Washington along 14th Street NW.

While Hispanics without green cards stream into the country to get jobs, open businesses, and soak the welfare system, the mayor and the city council seem to ""look the other way,"" Hughes said.</br></br>In a Feb. 6 column, my friend and colleague Courtland Milloy offered a curious defense of Muhammad and Farrakhan, who has a history of demonizing Jewish people: ""I believe Farrakhan sets out to incite Jews not so much because he hates them but because Jewish reactions to attack are instructive. A minority with a history of oppression, Jews command respect,"" Milloy wrote. ""You don't see them begging or apologizing for defending themselves."""

"Wall Street is counting on Federal Reserve officials to lower their target for overnight interest rates today by three-quarters of a percentage point to help the hapless stock market regain its footing and keep the economy from sliding into a recession.</br></br>Wall Street may well be disappointed. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has promised that the central bank will respond ""aggressively"" to the abrupt slowing of U.S. economic growth, but it's far from clear exactly what that means in the swirling crosscurrents of the U.S. and world economies. Furthermore, the Fed's top policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee, has most often changed its rate target in quarter-point increments, and a half-point could be considered aggressive.</br></br>A survey of 121 analysts and economists completed yesterday by Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a financial markets research firm, found that nearly two-thirds of them believe the Fed will cut the 5.5 percent target by only half a point.

PepsiCo declined to reveal how much its commodity costs have risen, Cash corn prices surged 57% from December 2005 through December 2006 amid growing demand for ethanol and other pressures.</br></br>The price of orange-juice futures climbed more than 60% in 2006 on the New York Board of Trade, as hurricane damage in Florida constrained supplies.</br></br>Sales of sports drink Gatorade and Tropicana Pure Premium orange juice declined in the fourth quarter, accompanied by continued drops in soda sales. Stronger-than-expected results from the company's Frito-Lay North America unit, PepsiCo's largest source of profit, showed how the company is offsetting rising costs by raising prices, improving productivity and churning out new snacks.</br></br>The company's strongest results came from its fast-growing international division, with operating profit rising 26%. Snack volume rose 9%, with particularly strong sales in Mexico and Russia, while beverage volume rose 7%, led by sales in the Middle East, Argentina, China and Brazil."
"You can't escape Internet Insanity these days. Scarcely a week passes, it seems, without us reading, hearing or seeing a story about how some company most of us never heard of will make a gazillion dollars from the Internet, the international network that lets computers communicate with one another. The world is full of people buying Internet stocks in search of the next Microsoft Corp. But you don't need to know much about Web browsers or servers or other high-technology stuff to see that it's almost impossible for any of today's Internet stocks to be the next Microsoft.</br></br>It's a question of math, not technology. Even with the sharp drops of the past three trading days, stocks of Internet companies are trading at levels I consider insanely high. If you overpay for the stock of even a very good company, it's almost impossible to make a superior long-term profit. And long-term profit is what we small nonprofessional investors should worry about. You short-term types, find a different article to read.</br></br>The simplest illustration is Netscape Communications Corp., which sold stock in August at $28 a share and currently sells for almost five times as much. Netscape's backers says the company will use its World Wide Web browser technology (which lets you find things on the Internet) to dominate the Internet the way that Microsoft parlayed its operating system technology into domination of large parts of the PC software business. But even if Netscape ends up wildly successful, it's virtually impossible for anyone buying Netscape stock at today's prices to get a Microsoft-like return. Here's why. If you bought 100 shares of Microsoft at its initial public offering in 1986 for $2,100, you now own 1,800 shares worth $158,400 at yesterday's closing price. Call it a 75-to-1 return in just under 10 years.</br></br>Netscape closed yesterday at $130.25 a share. For you to make a 75-to-1 return in less than 10 years, Netscape stock has to rise to almost $9,800 a share by the year-end of 2004. Its 40.8 million shares (including stock under option, as do all the valuations in this article) are valued in the stock market at around $5.3 billion. For you to buy now and make a Microsoft return, Netscape shares have to be worth almost $400 billion in less than 10 years.</br></br>How much is $400 billion? It's more than seven times the current value of all the shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. or Microsoft. About 13 Walt Disney Cos. Almost as much as General Electric Co., Exxon Corp., AT&T Corp. and Coca-Cola Co. combined. You don't need a doctorate in higher mathematics to see that's sort of unlikely."
"Investors in stocks and bonds are paying prices that indicate they believe a snowballing housing crisis and worsening credit crunch will soon tip the U.S. economy into a recession, analysts said. Many economists, including leaders of the Federal Reserve, don't think things will get that bad, but some say the risk of a serious downturn has risen in recent weeks.</br></br>Investors were so eager to buy ultra-safe government bonds yesterday that they were willing to accept sharply lower interest rates. The rate on the 10-year Treasury bond fell to 3.84 percent from 4 percent Friday. The low rates indicate investors expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates aggressively in the coming year to ease the pain of recession.</br></br>Stocks are now down more than 10 percent from their peak in October. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.3 percent yesterday, dropping the market to a level that Wall Street analysts say reflects an expectation that corporate profits will fall.</br></br>Taken together, those and other data indicate that financial markets have a decidedly negative prognosis for the economy. ""They're saying the odds of a recession are pretty damn high,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial.</br></br>There are reasons to think things will not get that bad, however. Holiday sales started Friday with a strong 8.3 percent gain over last year, and U.S. consumers have proven resilient in past periods of financial distress. With the dollar weakening, U.S. exporters will be at an advantage; joblessness remains near historic lows, at 4.7 percent; and the stock market, an old joke goes, has predicted nine of the past five recessions."
"Once every month, James Druckrey, marketing vice president of American Tourister Inc., sits down with top executives of the Warren, R.I., luggage maker to forecast the coming month's business.</br></br>For the past year, the very first item on his agenda has been the Conference Board's latest reading on consumer confidence. Right now, its reading is abysmal.</br></br>So, one would expect to find Mr. Druckrey pessimistic. But he isn't. ""We're guardedly optimistic there will be some turnaround in the economy,"" he says.</br></br>Production planners in businesses around the country are facing the same paradox: Business seems to be turning up, but some closely watched measures of consumer confidence aren't.</br></br>Last week, the Conference Board, a business-research organization based in New York, said its confidence index had fallen to the lowest level since the bleak, oil-shock days of December 1974. In short order, stock prices sank; Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan pronounced the report ""very disturbing""; USA Today and the Washington Post put the bad news at the top of their front pages, and CBS made it the lead story on its evening news."
"The U.S. Border Patrol has just unveiled a total makeover of its traditional uniform. Shiny badges and other emblems of law enforcement are out. Our frontier troops will now have a look more in keeping with their role as frontier troops, with lightweight fatigues and better weapons. Agent Ramon Ramirez told the Associated Press that the new garb looks more military, ""like you mean business.""</br></br>In Stafford County, Va., a 50-man company called McQ has started work on a $100,000 contract to develop a ""smart rock"" for the Department of Homeland Security. McQ, whose motto is ""Tough sensors for an insensitive planet,"" says that its rocks, embedded with acoustic and motion sensors, will be able to detect illegal immigrants and other miscreants sneaking across our borders.</br></br>The firm expects its contract for developing the rocks to grow to $1 million by fall -- a sure sign that while immigration ""reform"" bills may come and go, the threat of illegal immigration will continue to expand. This is a certainty not because of the state of the Mexican economy or because of government laxity here, but because border control is now an integral part of the military-industrial national security system, which has a long history of profiteering from purported dangers to our safety.</br></br>These are that system's immutable laws: 1) The ""threat,"" as portrayed to the public, always increases in direct proportion to the amount of money lavished on confronting it, and 2) every extra dollar appropriated for this purpose brings a progressively less effective counter to the threat, thus requiring that even more money be spent. Meanwhile, reality -- the scope and shape of whatever threat is being pressed into service -- is usually at sharp variance with the official picture, which leads to: 3) The ""other side"" can usually be maneuvered to react in a way that justifies further efforts on our part.</br></br>This system evolved, and reached its most perfect form, during the Cold War. Decade after decade, the American taxpayer was presented with a Soviet military machine that allegedly far outclassed our own puny efforts at military buildup and would shortly be in a position to have its way with us -- unless we invested the requisite treasure in various systems to counter the threat. Yet despite the billions lavished on our defenses, we never seemed to be able to match the foe's advertised military might."

"NEW YORK -- If you knew -- just knew -- that a company would post a 15% earnings gain every year, how much would you pay for the stock?</br></br>In the case of Abbott Laboratories, many investors are behaving as if that wasn't a hypothetical question. Based in North Chicago, Ill., Abbott makes medical diagnostic equipment, hospital supplies, drugs and infant formula. Its profit has increased each year since 1971, almost always in the vicinity of 15%.</br></br>Earnings predictability has made Abbott a favorite on Wall Street. At least 10 brokerage houses recommend it in glowing terms. The stock has marched from below 50 early this year to Friday's close of 70, up 3/4. Abbott shares sell for 19 times the past 12 months' earnings -- a multiple that suggests investors think nothing can go wrong.</br></br>But there's a difference between a great company and a great stock, a few skeptics say. If investors expect earnings to rise 15% forever, they say, disappointments are more likely than pleasant surprises.</br></br>The stock's legion of fans don't seem to be expecting any surprises, period.

"Investors have shoveled almost $14 trillion into U.S. mutual funds, but a good chunk of that money is riding on mistaken assumptions.</br></br>Example: buying a fund based primarily on past performance, the most frequently cited factor in choosing funds (by 47% of investors), according to a report from research and consulting firm Cerulli Associates.</br></br>Apparently, the familiar refrain that ""past performance is no indicator of future results"" isn't top of mind when we decide where to invest our hard-earned money. You can't really blame investors. Historical returns are trumpeted in advertising and fund disclosures, and past results are a reasonable guide in our own day-to-day experiences.</br></br>Indeed, when choosing a fund ""one of the few things you're given is past performance,"" says Shlomo Benartzi, a UCLA professor and chief behavioral economist at Allianz. ""And, after you experienced so many things in your life where past performance will tell you a lot about what will happen, we're now asking you to take the most salient available information you have and ignore that.""</br></br>The good news is that more investors appear to be cost-conscious. ""The cost of the fund"" was the second most commonly cited factor in choosing a fund (42% of investors), says the Cerulli report. ""The message is getting out there that we cannot control performance, but we can certainly control costs,"" says George Papadopoulos, a financial planner in Novi, Mich., a Detroit suburb."
"Bond traders are, by nature, skittish and high-strung folk who tend to react even to mundane announcements as if they had just received news of the Apocalypse. On Feb. 4 and then again on March 22, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan tried to nudge up interest rates in a prudent, cautionary style. This was less an attempt to stifle inflation than a measured attempt to forestall it. But the bond market, with its monomania about inflation and almost biblical sense of foreboding, heard the trumpet blasts of doom and sent the walls of the stock market tumbling down.</br></br>Pity poor Alan Greenspan. Believing that he was lighting a small firecracker, he instead touched off a major financial explosion on Wall Street. Yesterday President Clinton was forced to reassure a queasy public that ""no one believes that there is a serious problem with the underlying American economy. It is healthy and it is sound.""</br></br>Clearly, the stock market has arrived at a difficult turning point, grappling with the first tightening of monetary policy in five years. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, it enjoyed the giddy elixir of disinflation. Whenever the rate of price increases tumbles gently over a sustained period, financial markets tend to float up on a wave of euphoria. With that halcyon period now over, investors have assumed -- much too quickly, to my mind -- that we will now revert to the status quo ante, i.e. to the panicky inflationary turmoil of the 1970s.</br></br>If the world of the mid-1990s even remotely resembled those parlous days, such fears might be valid. But the reality is that stock traders now perceive the present through the darkly distorting prism of the past. With inflation running at a mild 3% rate and with the consumer price index in January actually registering zero, the inflation hysteria stems from memories of past behavior, rather than from currently observed phenomena. Scattered price rises in some metals, paper products and chemicals in recent months would hardly seem to warrant the grotesque theatrics of recent weeks.</br></br>During the pell-mell exodus from stocks and bonds, financial markets have overlooked a multitude of trends that will damp (but by no means eliminate) inflation in the remaining years of this decade. Today the world stands in the throes of ferocious competition, a highly creative if deeply unsettling force that is redrawing the economic landscape everywhere. Both at home and abroad, companies and workers are at the mercy of rapidly shifting markets, instead of being their masters. In corporate boardrooms, managers no longer plot to raise prices but contrive ways to cut costs and boost efficiency."
"WINCHENDON, Mass. -- Money still grows on trees.</br></br>Timberland, which a few years ago became a popular investment among institutions and wealthy folks, has held up amid market massacres for most other assets lately.</br></br>Through Sept. 30, the value of timberland rose 5%. When the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries reports 2008's final quarter this week, this number is unlikely to move much. That marks a slower pace of growth, yet it is growth nonetheless. In 2007, timber appreciation was a towering 15%.</br></br>How can positive returns exist in these dark days of shrunken prices for everything ranging from real estate to commodities to stocks? Oil, after a summer price spike, was down 54% in 2008, while corn lost 11% and copper 54%. (Gold, as a refuge commodity, rose 6%.) Prices for lumber, a key forest product, have fallen by 34% over the past year as housing construction has ebbed.</br></br>The answer to this riddle is that timberland is the ultimate long-term investment, with relatively little bought and sold each year -- and demand still respectable for what does change hands. ""As long as the sun shines, the trees will grow,"" says Jeremy Grantham, chairman of Boston money manager GMO and a long-time fan of timber investing. ""Timber will never be an orphan."""
"Many people fear that high inflation is right around the corner. The evidence says they shouldn't.</br></br>Still, there are moves investors can take that will pay off even if inflation is low and provide ample benefit if inflation takes off.</br></br>For now, the market is sanguine -- though some high-profile individuals aren't.

Richard Shelby (R., Ala.), who voted against the nomination, explained his opposition to the Fed's easy-money policies.</br></br>Said Sen.

These aren't motorcycle mags, they're biker mags. There's a big difference. Motorcycle magazines are about motorcycles -- their frames, their spark plugs, their airflow.

""We're popping the rubber band off the bankroll and paying out $20 for every shot we use.""</br></br>These magazines are not for the squeamish or the politically correct. They're fun, though, if you're willing to take them in the spirit in which they're offered -- a spirit captured in their subtitles.

"Embedded in Alan Greenspan‰Ûªs central-banker rhetoric to Congress last week was terrible news for President Clinton: The Federal Reserve will not run an inflationary policy to soften the havoc wrought by higher taxes.</br></br>Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan's circumlocutions obscured the hard reality. Present low short-term interest rates are insupportable and will be raised by the Fed; the question is not if. but when.

"President-elect Clinton said in an interview released yesterday he is determined to make a major reduction in the federal deficit during his term in office but said to meet his campaign pledge of halving the deficit by 1996 he will have to make deeper spending cuts than he contemplated last summer.</br></br>His choice for budget chief, Rep. Leon E.

The $145 billion would have been about half the 1993 deficit that was projected when he made the pledge.</br></br>But according to Clinton, since he first said he would halve the deficit, tax and spending projections have worsened and that to meet his goal he will have to be harsher than he anticipated.</br></br>""We‰Ûªre going to have to cut more in other places ... than we would have thought ... because the deficit's gotten bigger.

But this would mean cannibalizing Time Warner's pre-existing Road Runner broadband service, something the Time Warnerites evidently were unwilling to do."
"That's the philosophy of retailers at the holiday season, judging by the predictably exuberant quality of their ads. Doorbuster deals! Midnight madness! Gobblepalooza!</br></br>Such hyperventilation has become par for the course on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving that traditionally kicks off the holiday shopping season. That one day accounted for nearly $11 billion in sales last year, according to research firm ShopperTrak.</br></br>But as the country stumbles toward economic recovery, one short day is apparently no longer enough to win the hearts and minds - and wallets - of American consumers, particularly when retailers rely on holiday shopping to ring up as much as half of their annual sales. In recent years, the industry has filled the calendar with a slew of new landmark shopping days to keep consumers fired up right through Christmas.</br></br>There is Small Business Saturday, started by American Express this year to send customers to those long-suffering mom-and-pop shops. Then comes Cyber Monday, created by a trade group, when we return to work after Thanksgiving and collectively slack off by shopping online. Free Shipping Day, the brainchild of a coupon site, comes next. And Super Saturday, a retail industry term, rounds out the season on the last weekend before Christmas.</br></br>As the calendar has become more crowded, retailers have resorted to increasingly far-fetched ideas to stand out. Infomercials tried to muscle into the game with a short-lived Info-Mania Sunday in 2007. That was the same year Wal-Mart called for Friday to be stretched over two days - a 48-hour Black Friday to accommodate its deals.

"WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve made its boldest bid since February to get the economy moving again, cutting two key interest rates.</br></br>The Fed dropped its discount rate to 4.5% from 5% and cut the federal funds rate to 4.75% from 5%. Together, the moves prompted banks to cut their prime lending rates to 7.5% from 8%. Other interest rates are likely to fall as well.</br></br>The action followed a meeting Tuesday of the Fed's policy committee, during which officials talked at length about the pessimism that has gripped the U.S. economy, according to some who attended. They noted the sharp drop in consumer confidence in October, as well as the sour attitude of many business executives, including those who sit on the boards of the 12 district Federal Reserve Banks.</br></br>In response to that crisis of confidence, Fed officials decided to take more dramatic action than usual, to give a psychological kick to the economy. The effect was amplified by the fact that it came just one week after the central bank's previous credit-easing move, when it cut the federal funds rate to 5% from 5.25%.</br></br>The federal funds rate is the interest rate that banks charge on loans to each other, and broadly influences other shortterm interest rates. The discount rate is the rate the Fed charges on loans to financial institutions, and is important largely for its symbolic value."

However, employment contracted again, for the 32nd month in a row, the survey found.</br></br>""Supply managers' comments seem to be split among those who are starting to see improvement, those who see no improvement in sight, and those who are uncertain as to the direction,"" said Norbert Ore, chairman of the ISM's manufacturing-survey committee and a purchasing executive at Georgia-Pacific Corp. ""This is not really unusual when the economy is at a crossroads.""</br></br>The index hardly suggests the robust activity of a normal recovery. After expanding most of last year, manufacturing had sunk into a recession in recent months.

It is tapping a glut of trained technicians and hungry-for-work service companies, aiming to make the unsexy business of maintaining and servicing computers for corporations its next big moneymaker.</br></br>The low-cost structure mirrors the way Dell revolutionized the PC business a decade ago. While competitors designed their PCs with special bells and whistles and filled warehouses with them, Dell bought components off the shelf and built the computers to customers' orders, reducing overhead and keeping prices low.</br></br>With services, ""we can do it differently,"" insists Dell President Kevin B. Rollins. He says Dell's approach results in service costs that are 20% lower than rivals', and predicts the fast-growing business will contribute $10 billion in annual revenue within a few years, up from about $1.5 billion today. By contrast, such services contributed $9.5 billion to Hewlett-Packard Co.'s revenue and $25.1 billion to International Business Machines Corp.'s last year.</br></br>Yet unlike IBM and H-P, Dell won't repair other manufacturers' equipment, focusing instead on the nearly 90 million computers it has sold in the past five years.

"WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department trimmed its estimate of the economy's fourth-quarter growth rate to a sluggish 1.3% annual rate from the 1.7% reported earlier.</br></br>The weak fourth-quarter expansion in the real gross national product -- the inflation-adjusted value of the nation's output of goods and services -- followed growth at a 2.8% rate in the third quarter. For all of 1986, the economy grew at a 2.5% rate.</br></br>Several economists asserted that the new report suggests the economy is poised for a pick-up in growth. The revision occurred largely because the department found that nonfarm inventory investment was lower in the fourth quarter than originally reported.</br></br>""The story is the big decline in inventories and what that implies for the first quarter,"" said David Berson, senior economist at Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates in Philadelphia, who predicted that businesses will rebuild inventories in the first quarter.

"More Liquidity Only Douses Growth Sparks</br></br>Today's ultralow interest rates have helped boost profits, but not economic growth.</br></br>This is plainly evident in recent figures.

Indeed, in real terms, gross domestic product hasn't even returned to its prerecession peak.</br></br>On Friday, Commerce data is likely to show GDP losing further ground. Second-quarter growth, originally reported at a measly 1.3%, is expected to be revised down to 1% in part because exports proved weaker than first thought.

The shadow play is revealing of what is too little and certainly too late in the administration approach.</br></br>When he announced in his ""conversation"" with the television interlocutors that he would ask for no new taxes, the President shut the door on meaningful remedies for inflation on the one hand and the plight of the bankrupt states and cities on the other. A tentative trial balloon was sent up for a value-added tax on manufactured goods; in effect, a sales tax. It would have taken courage to propose such a lax and real grit to try to push it through a balky Congress with Democratic majorities conditioned against sueh a tax or, for that matter, any new taxes."
"Facing unprecedented inflation, panic buying and social discontent, Communist Party leaders have retreated from proposals for an immediate, radical transformation of China's centrally controlled pricing system.</br></br>Meeting at the seaside resort of Beidaihe, the party's ruling Politburo has approved a compromise draft document on reforming the system of prices and wages, effectively postponing difficult decisions on the issue.</br></br>China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, had been pressing for price reform-seen by some Chinese as the key to the success of all other economic reforms implemented in the last 10 years-that would go far beyond any measures previously attempted by a communist country. But instead the leaders adopted a more cautious, step-by-step approach.</br></br>The aim of price reform is to allow most prices to reflect true production costs, thus increasing efficiency in systems dominated by arbitrarily set prices and subsidies. China's reform program has been aimed at restructuring its rigidly planned, Soviet-style economic system to one receptive to market forces.</br></br>Price reform is supposed to make it possible to determine profits and losses with greater accuracy and eliminate the widespread corruption in the country's two-tier system of state-set and floating prices. This results in part from profiteers, who, with the assistance of certain party officials, buy commodities at low, state-set prices and then sell them at higher prices on the free market."
"WASHINGTON -- Two of Bill Clinton's top advisers gave the strongest signal in recent days that the president-elect's economic plan is likely to include some modest short-term fiscal stimulus.</br></br>In separate Senate confirmation hearings yesterday, Deputy Budget Director-designate Alice Rivlin and Deputy Treasury Secretary-designate Roger Altman both spoke of the importance of ensuring that the economic recovery not falter, and indicated that spending increases or tax cuts might be appropriate.</br></br>Lately Mr. Clinton's aides have emphasized the need for reducing the deficit above all else. And neither Ms. Rivlin nor Mr. Altman backed away from that commitment. Still, they suggested that a plan featuring stimulus in the short run and deficit-reduction in the longer term would perhaps make the most sense of all.</br></br>""We are clearly operating this economy below capacity . . . so at the moment it would be risky to bring the deficit down quickly,"" Ms. Rivlin told the Governmental Affairs Committee. ""We probably need to engage in some stimulus for the economy.""</br></br>Appearing before the Finance Committee, Mr. Altman said: ""There are three ingredients to a bold economic plan -- some stimulus now, an increasing rate of government investment"" and a reduction in the budget deficit."

Now, with all of the derivatives -- and derivatives of derivatives -- one can be 100% on target about fundamentals, but still lose money because folks on the other side of the trade have not just hedged, but taken huge positions using derivatives.""</br></br>Ferrari, who co-owns the Integrity Group, a security consultancy in Pleasanton, Calif., says those positions have forced him to change his own. ""Normally, at this point in my life, I'd be 90% invested in the stock market; I'd have bonds and real estate, as well,"" he says. ""Today, I'm just not feeling comfortable.""</br></br>He's not alone. Just 13% of workers surveyed in January of 2009 were ""very confident"" about having enough money to retire comfortably, down from 16% in 2008 and 27% in 2007, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute's latest Retirement Confidence Survey. Another 44% of workers were split evenly between being ""not too confident"" and ""not at all confident"" about having enough for retirement. Current retirees were also feeling insecure about their savings. Only 20% of retirees expressed full confidence in having enough funds to last them through retirement, down from 29% in 2008 and 41% in 2007, according to the EBRI survey."

"NEW YORK, July 15 ‰ÛÓ With an ease that seems to border on abandon,major banks are putting together record-sized lines of credit for big companies that are stalking takeover targets and for slightly smaller concerns who might wield the credits to defend their independence.</br></br>Mobil Corp., which said it may be interested in buying beleaguered Conoco Inc., is arranging a $5 billion credit line through a syndicate of banks headed by Citibank.</br></br>E.I. du Pont de Nemours, which has made an offer for Conoco (and which is Conoco‰Ûªs preferred suitor), arranged $3 billion in loan commitments last week and another $1 billion this week. Texaco reportedly has a line of credit of $5.5 billion it was putting together last week, while Pennzoil can draw up to $2.5 billion from its bankers. And Marathon Oil Co., said to be a takeover target, revealed today it is lining up a new credit line through a Chase Manhattan syndicate.</br></br>Conoco is taking no chances that White Knight Du Pont will give in to the Canadian distiller Seagram (which has made an ‰ÛÏunfriendly5 bid for Conoco) or Mobil, should it make an offer. The Stamford, Conn.-based Conoca has arranged a $3 billion credit line of its own that could be used to buy its own stock in an attempt to thwart a takeover.

"Author: Sudeep Reddy</br></br>The Federal Reserve spent the past three decades getting inflation low and keeping it there. But as the U.S. economy struggles and flirts with the prospect of deflation, some central bank officials are publicly broaching a controversial idea: lifting inflation above the Fed's informal target.</br></br>The rationale is that getting inflation up even temporarily would push ""real"" interest rates--nominal rates minus inflation--down, encouraging consumers and businesses to save less and to spend or invest more.</br></br>Both inside and outside the Fed, though, such an approach is controversial. It could undermine the anti-inflation credibility the Fed won three decades ago by raising interest rates to double-digits to beat back late-1970s price surges. ""It's a big mistake,"" said Allan Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon University, a central bank historian. ""Higher inflation is not going to solve our problem. Any gain from that experience would be temporary,"" adding that the economy would suffer later.</br></br>Others warn that pushing inflation higher than the target could create public confusion and risk fueling financial bubbles and market instability. They say Fed policy already is weakening the dollar and as a result prompting a gold and commodity boom. ""The Fed is treading upon a mine-laden path that has never been tip-toed through in this country,"" said Andrew Busch, a currency strategist at BMO Capital Markets."

Dillon, International Paper Co.'s chief executive and the new head of the Business Roundtable, pleaded his case at a private meeting with Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill yesterday. The dollar's strength against the yen and euro, he said, makes it too hard for U.S. companies to compete with imports and to penetrate foreign markets.</br></br>""There's no question that orders for our products have been off for about a year, and foreign companies are taking an increasing share of the U.S. market,"" Mr. Dillon said after the meeting with Mr. O'Neill. ""It's not that their factories are any more efficient than our factories, but they do have a pretty sizable advantage because of the dollar's relationship with other currencies.""</br></br>During the past two weeks, the dollar has surged to 15-year highs both against the British pound -- down to $1.3981 in late New York trading yesterday from $1.4007 a day earlier -- and against a basket of currencies of major U.S. trading partners. The euro, which sold for 85.45 U.S. cents late yesterday, is 27% weaker against the dollar than when the 12-nation currency made its debut on Jan. 1, 1999.</br></br>Mr. Dillon said industrial America is in a ""deep recession,"" and that the administration should let the markets know that the U.S. is no longer inclined to prop up the dollar."
"WASHINGTON -- Business inventories rose 0.7% in July while sales fell 0.5%, the Commerce Department reported, another indication that the economy is vulnerable to recession.</br></br>Economists have been watching inventory levels closely, fearing that if stockpiles of unsold goods grow too high, businesses will cut back on orders and production. With the economy barely growing, the chain reaction could lead to a recession.</br></br>July's rise in inventories followed a 0.5% decline in June.</br></br>The figures ""are not worrisome in themselves, but taken with other data seen of late they suggest we are dealing with an economy that is fragile,"" said Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co., Chicago, pointing to recent declines in retail sales and housing starts and an increase in the unemployment rate.</br></br>Aubrey Zaffuto, vice president and economist at IBJ Schroder Bank & Trust Co., New York, predicted there will be a cut in production to offset the growing inventory figures. ""People are intolerant of small increases in inventories,"" she said."
"Strong income gains and unseasonably warm weather prompted consumers to spend more money than usual in January. Along with data showing manufacturing activity expanded in February, that suggests the economy is on track for robust first-quarter growth.</br></br>Personal income of Americans increased 0.7% in January, the biggest jump since September, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The gain amounted to roughly $75.2 billion. At the same time, consumer spending increased 0.9%, about $76.7 billion, the largest climb in six months.</br></br>The January spending jump follows a soft fourth quarter, which led economists and retailers to worry about an economic slowdown. But the latest data confirm other recent reports that show consumer spending picked up again in January, and that the broad-based gains should ripple throughout the economy.</br></br>Consumer spending is ""strengthening sharply in the first quarter"" said Dean Maki, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Capital. He estimates that consumer spending in the first quarter will grow at an annualized rate of 4.5% or more, compared with 1.2% in the fourth quarter. Spending is ""recovering after the post-hurricane lull"" and sluggish auto sales late last year, he said.</br></br>The large gain in personal income was the result mainly of rising wages and salaries, which partly reflects rising employment. The economy added 193,000 new nonfarm jobs in January. But Uncle Sam also contributed to the January income increase as the Medicare prescription-drug plan, an increase in cost-of-living adjustments for recipients of Social Security and some other federal programs boosted transfer payments. Meantime, pay raises for federal civilian and military personnel boosted government wage and salary disbursements. Excluding these special factors, personal income increased 0.4% in January, BEA says."
"NEW YORK -- Despite additional evidence of low inflation, Federal Reserve System officials still fear that the economy is growing too rapidly and that inflation could surge by early next year.</br></br>As a result, the Fed, whose policy-making arm meets today and tomorrow, probably will try to keep short-term interest rates in the next few weeks close to their current lofty levels, or slightly higher, according to bankers, economists and sources close to the Fed.</br></br>Some congressional critics contend that such a policy could lead to economic disaster. Rep. Jack Kemp (R., N.Y.) argues that the Fed's credit policy already is much too tight and has intensified international financial strains. He also insists that Wall Street fears about inflation are wildly exaggerated, especially in view of continued continued declines in commodity prices as well as a government report Friday showing the producer price index remained unchanged in June for the third consecutive month.</br></br>Nevertheless, many analysts predict that the Fed this week will decide to keep a firm grip on credit conditions, and possibly even tighten its clamp slightly, in an effort to cool off the economy and keep inflation subdued. ""If the Fed wants to make sure that inflation isn't going to worsen, then it must slow the growth of the economy,"" says Robert G. Dederick, executive vice president of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. Mr. Dederick, who was a Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs in the Reagan administration, adds: ""I still think it's likely that the Fed will tighten slightly further.""</br></br>Some analysts insist that the Fed committee won't make any change in credit conditions at this week's meeting. They argue that the economy already is slowing enough on its own and that any additional credit-tightening moves by the Fed would represent overkill. Also, they point out that two of the three money-supply measures that the Fed monitors remain within its targets for this year."
"All year long, economists and government policy makers have been surprised at the strength of consumer spending. The chart at right shows a key underlying reason for that surprising robustness - the strength of the 1994 job market.</br></br>Late in 1993, most forecasters predicted that 1994 would be a good year for the economy, with growth sufficiently solid to reduce the unemployment rate modestly. Instead, consumer purchases soared, especially for expensive, long-lasting goods, such as new cars and furniture, and the economy took off. By last month the unemployment rate was down to 5.6 percent, compared with 6.7 percent in January.</br></br>The whole process fed on itself, in a fashion reminiscent of the burst of economic activity - which economists sometimes call a ""snapback"" - that usually comes immediately after a recession. More spending triggered more production, more production meant more jobs and more income yielded more spending.</br></br>Years ago, when he was a private economic consultant, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan closely watched the layoff rate - a figure that later fell victim to budget cuts at the Bureau of Labor Statistics - for an early signal that a recession was about to end. Greenspan said that when the layoff rate began to fall and workers who had feared for their jobs began to relax, those still at work were apt to increase their discretionary spending once more.</br></br>The chart underscores the unusual nature of the business cycle that began when the economy slumped in the summer of 1990 and began to recover the following spring. For a variety of reasons - including huge business and consumer debt loads and a financial system in deep trouble - there was no snapback. As many firms sought to cut costs to cope with the new low-inflation environment and fierce competitive pressure from foreign producers, they continued to lay off workers - long after the economy started growing again. In the manufacturing sector in particular, productivity gains allowed firms to increase production while cutting their labor force."
"Government Spending Holds Key to Growth</br></br>As goes government spending, so goes the U.S. economy.</br></br>This is the unpleasant reality a weak recovery and already stretched Federal Reserve have bequeathed. Absent a sudden pick-up in private-sector activity, economic growth in the months ahead will largely take its cue from Congress and the White House. No wonder markets are jittery.</br></br>For one, the hit from spending cuts across all levels of government has already been a major drag on growth. Indeed, these declines shaved 0.7 percentage point on average from gross domestic product growth in the first two quarters of 2011. Typically, that would be no disaster. Trouble is, this recovery has been unusually weak. So the government cutbacks effectively halved real GDP growth in the first half of 2011, leaving it at just 0.8% annualized.</br></br>The pace of underlying growth is expected to pick up a bit in coming months. But so, too, is the pace of government spending cuts. A glimpse of this will come Wednesday with the release of July federal budget figures. These are expected to show a third month in a row of year-on-year declines in spending, or ""outlays,"" according to a preliminary analysis from the Congressional Budget Office. Their estimates show spending is down nearly 12% on average since May from a year earlier."

"direction of interest rates in 1991 are easy to identify, the health of the economy and the Federal Reserve‰Ûªs response to it A dearer picture of what happened to interest rates in 1991 is obtained by looking at short-term rates out to seven years and longer-term rates out to 30 years. Short rates fell under the sway of the wishes of the Fed, while the longer rates are affected by other forces.</br></br>Through the first half of the past year, there was the belief that once Operation Desert Storm in the Middle East had been terminated, consumers would begin to spend more and the economy would improve. The economy, as measured by the new gross domestic product, did finally improve in the third quarter, but it has been anemic ever since. At his recent congressional testimony, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan admitted that he was deceived into believing that the economy was improving, and only recently did he realize that the opposite was occurring.</br></br>AH of this anticipation has been borne out in the movement of interest rates this year. Through the middle of the year, short rates moved somewhat lower, while the longer rates moved higher. As a result, the Treasury yield curve, as measured from the two-year note to the 30-year bond, steepened from 102 basis points to 146 basis points. It wasn't until the last half of the year, and especially in November and December when the Fed dropped the discount rate by 150 basis points, that the curve moved to a much more positive 276 basis points.</br></br>The distinction to be made here is that the Fed, in controlling both the discount rate and the federal funds rate, was able to control short rates out to seven years. In its recent dramatic reduction of the discount rate by a full percentage point to 3.5	percent, the Fed served notice of its concern about the economy and its fears of what the government might do in the way of ‰ÛÏhelping the situation through tax cuts and increased spending.</br></br>William Griggs, co-author of the Griggs & Santow Report, a weekly Wall Street money market newsletter, believes that long interest rates have been influenced by the perception that tire economy‰Ûªs problems are not just cyclical in nature, but : are long-run problems that would be present long after the recovery was underway and, in feet, that these problems - ‰ÐÊ would have a negative influence on the recovery itself."
"For Republicans, Social Security reform could be the kind of donnybrook that health care reform was for Democrats in 1994. The magnitude of the political risk is staggering. On Capitol Hill, many Republicans wonder if they are being led off a cliff. What does President Bush think he's doing?</br></br>Well, he says, there's a Social Security crisis. ""The crisis is now,"" Bush said in December. But he must know this isn't true. Economically speaking, stabilizing Social Security's long-term finances is a task of only middling difficulty and importance. It requires no fundamental change in the program and need not be tackled right away. As for private Social Security accounts, they are -- again, economically speaking -- a solution in search of a problem.</br></br>No, what Bush and the Republicans are focused on is not the economy, stupid. It is conservative social engineering on the grandest possible scale.</br></br>When people talk about Social Security reform, they usually mean reforms, plural. They're usually linking two changes that are conceptually and mechanically distinct. Reform No. 1 would reduce the growth of benefits -- or raise payroll taxes -- to bring the program into long-term fiscal balance. Reform No. 2 would structurally revamp the program by creating private accounts: A portion of your Social Security payroll tax would go into an investment account with your name on it instead of going to the U.S. Treasury to finance the benefits of current retirees, as now happens.</br></br>Congress can adopt one idea, both ideas or neither. Either, by itself, is politically difficult; doing both -- simultaneously cutting and restructuring the program -- is audacious. Yet that is what Bush seems likely to propose. Why take the chance? On close examination, the economic payoffs are unimpressive. The moral and political dividends are potentially another matter."

"NEW DELHI--The U.S. ambassador to New Delhi said Tuesday that India needs to consider whether it is delivering on its side of the new close alliance with the U.S. and do more to tackle graft and encourage foreign investment or the nation's economic expansion risks losing steam.</br></br>""India needs to be asking itself: Is it delivering on the global partnership?"" Timothy Roemer said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal as he prepares to leave the post next month and return to the U.S. ""The international business community that was pouring money and investment potential into India last year and the year before is now pausing and saying: 'Where is India heading in terms of investment opportunities, the corruption challenge and inflation?'""</br></br>If this perception doesn't change, he added, India could see downward revisions of as much as two percentage points to estimates for growth this year, considering the impact of higher oil prices and high inflation. Earlier this month, C. Rangarajan, chairman of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council, forecast Gross Domestic Product growth in the year ending March 31, 2012, of 8.5%, below the government's forecast of 9%, as a series of interest rate rises to combat high inflation crimps growth. A spokesman for the Prime Minister's Office had no immediate comment.</br></br>Foreign direct investment in India, after rising steadily for years, totaled $18.4 billion from April 2010 to February, down 25% from a year earlier, according to Indian government data, amid a series of corruption scandals that have paralyzed the government and a lack of progress on economic reforms that would make the market more attractive for foreign firms.</br></br>Mr. Roemer's warning comes after two years - his tenure in New Delhi -- in which the U.S. and India have, in many respects, dramatically expanded their cooperation and partnership on issues ranging from counter-terrorism to environmentally-friendly technology to coordination over regional policy in Afghanistan."

"WASHINGTON -- Before initiating legislation to change the way the financial markets work, the Senate Banking Committee seems inclined to give the existing regulatory structure a chance to implement some of the reforms recommended by the Brady task force.</br></br>Four days of hearings by the panel last week made it clear that, less than a month after being released, the task force's central conclusion -- that the separate financial markets actually operate as one -- has become part of Washington's conventional wisdom.

"Gordon Crovitz's call for more high-tech immigrants repeats an argument we frequently see on the pages of the Journal ( Information Age, Oct. 1). Yet engineering work is shifting from developed countries to developing countries for a reason. Engineering, when done properly, follows international standards in proceduralizing the work. When engineering work is proceduralized, it can be outsourced, just as assembly work is procedural work that is more cost effectively done in low-wage developing countries. Importing millions of engineers from developing countries isn't going to change the macroeconomic laws that compel this outsourcing. It will worsen our economic plight because it works against our comparative advantage of integrating microeconomic behaviors into efficient macroeconomic function.</br></br>Most promising developing countries cannot grow past low GDP per capita levels because their microeconomic behavior tends toward collectivism, cronyism, mistrust of others, safety nets, corruption, dishonesty and envious slamming of those who are richer or more powerful. To improve our GDP, we need people who believe in individualism, merit, trust in financial transactions/investing, honesty, hard work and grit. Those microeconomic behaviors are the only means of boosting our economic function beyond the high GDP per capita barrier that is unreachable for almost all countries.</br></br>Tom Fix</br></br>Bellevue, Wash.</br></br>I am not opposed to letting skilled immigrants get a green card for working in the U.S. However, as the president of a high-tech company (six Ph.D.s among 17 employees), there is the risk of hiring too many of any one group, which will create a company within the company.

If taxes rise on everyone next year because of a stalemate, he says, ""who are you going to believe wants taxes to go up? Obama doesn't have credibility on keeping your taxes down; Republicans do.""</br></br>And don't forget: ""Nothing has changed on the chess board since Barack Obama agreed to extend all the Bush tax cuts two years ago.

"Federal Reserve officials are widely expected to leave short-term interest rates unchanged when they meet Tuesday and Wednesday, but they are also likely to say they are still more concerned about rising inflation than they are about signs the economy is slowing.</br></br>The choice facing policymakers next week, Fed officials say, is between leaving their target for overnight interest rates unchanged or raising them by a quarter of a percentage point. A large majority of investors and analysts are betting rates will not change.</br></br>The situation was very different when the central bank's top policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee, last met in mid-May. Then, the choice was between raising the rate target by a quarter-point or a half-point. The policymakers opted for the latter, lifting it to 6.5 percent, a cumulative increase of 1.75 percentage points over a period of less than 11 months.</br></br>But the statement issued at the end of next week's meeting undoubtedly will contain the same language as the one released last month: ""Against the background of its long-term goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information already available, the Committee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.""</br></br>In other words, Fed officials see no reason yet to believe rates are necessarily high enough to slow the economy enough to keep inflation at bay. They could well decide at the following meeting, Aug. 22, to raise rates again if new data indicate a rebound in growth."

"In normal times, the best advice after a market decline is ""Don't be afraid."" But these are not normal times, and anyone who is not afraid after a 50% market decline has a few screws loose. The trick is to channel your fear into sensible action that will improve your financial future.</br></br>Instead of big impulsive steps you may regret later, you should take small and careful steps that will make you feel you have taken charge. Mental-health experts have found that merely believing you have some control over a painful situation is enough to make the pain more bearable. At a time like this, taking a little bit of action can give you a lot of comfort -- both as an immediate salve for your market wounds today and as a portfolio strengthener in the years to come.</br></br>For investors, that means being deliberate in everything you do and making sure that all your decisions are gradual and incremental, rather than sudden and drastic. Call it ""smart panic"" -- calculated actions that free you from the chains of inertia without compelling you to go haywire.</br></br>Normally, inertia keeps investors locked into all their investments, good and bad. As Sir Isaac Newton might have put it, an investor at rest stays at rest, and an investor in motion stays in motion, unless acted upon by an outside force. Severe losses can shock any investor out of inertia, often in destructive ways.</br></br>Here is a list of constructive steps you can take instead:"
"Whether or not the Supreme Court does what ABC News said it will do and strikes down a critical part of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, we ought to be considering further changes in the federal budget process. The prospect of losing G-R-H only adds urgency, as the lead times for any new measures would be long.</br></br>The proposals most discussed in this vein are a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution, a presidential line-item veto, or perhaps a ""son of G-R-H"": reconstituting it if the court finds its present provisions invalid.</br></br>From the standpoint of sustaining long-term economic growth, none of these measures holds as much merit as requiring that the rate of growth in total federal spending should be no greater than the rate of growth of the gross national product. This rule would prevent the ratio of government spending to GNP from rising, as it characteristically has in the past.</br></br>Two central facts provide support for focusing on total spending as opposed to budget balancing or piecemeal paring.</br></br>First, a significant negative relationship exists between the rate of economic growth and the size of the government sector (as measured by government spending as a ratio to GNP, or by the tax take as a ratio to GNP). Depending on which measure of government size is used, as well as a number of other factors (for example, the particular countries and the time period considered), research done both at Rand and the World Bank suggests that for each increase of 1% in the size of government, long-term economic growth decreases between 0.1% and 0.6% annually in both developed and developing countries."

"HE POTOMAC LOOKS different down in Virginia near where Popes Creek joins the river. More serene, wider of course, tree-fringed and offering vistas that stretch the eye. It must have looked much the same when Thomas Lee, planter, burgess and acting governor of Virginia, built Stratford Hall in the 1720s and Augustine Washington built the house, upriver a bit, where George was bom.</br></br>‰Û¢	Tucked away off the beaten track in Westmoreland County, these two famous plantations are ohly a little more than a couple of horns from Washington and a nice excursion into the rural countryside. Both afford a glimpse into domestic life in the early 18th century that surprises us 20th-century voyeurs. Drive onto the roads that, lead to these houses from Rte. 3E and you drive clean out of our era ‰ÛÓ not because of the oxen and the costumed employes, but because this land was part of the beginning of America.</br></br>The Lees, of course, are as close as we come in this country to aristocracy, and the ancestral home .ia as impressive in its setting as any English castle. Stratford has had no majt.‰Ûª- changes since 1730. It was occupied until L822 by members of the Lee family, that remarkable line that produced two signers of the Declaration of Independence and a general of the Annies of the Confederacy. The lineage is all set forth in the re- ception center through which you pass before entering the house, and it‰Ûªs worth a quick look; the generations do confuse. You may, however, get sidetracked looking at the family christening dress and some of the Lee jewelry, like the mourning locket, in the adjacent cases.</br></br>There are only a few actual Lee pieces among the furniture in Stratford, but everything is authentic to the period, 1630-1810. The costumed hostesses, steeped in the Lee genealogy and each wearing a necklace featuring the squirrel so prominent in the Lee coat of arms, are full of wonderful stories about life in the old house.</br></br>Surely the most touching is the one about Robert E. Lee, not yet 4, who had to leave home with his mother and younger brothers when his half-brother inherited the house. With the coach waiting in the courtyard to take them to a new home, Robert turned up missing. After an extensive search, the child was discovered crouching in the nursery, whispering goodbye to the angels embossed against the back of the fireplace. Get down on your knees and look at the angels or you will regret it."

For several years now, inflation as measured through the consumer price index has been mild. It started to decline after reaching 13.5% in 1980, slid to 10.3% the following year and to 6.2% in 1982.

"An unusually large share of workers have been out a job for more than six months even as overall unemployment has remained low, a little-noted weakness in the labor market that analysts said threatens to intensify the impact of the unfolding economic downturn.</br></br>In November, nearly 1.4 million people -- almost one in five of those unemployed -- had been jobless for at least 27 weeks, the juncture when unemployment insurance benefits end for most recipients. That is about twice the level of long-term unemployment before the 2001 recession.</br></br>The problem is ensnaring a broader swath of workers than before. Once concentrated among manufacturing workers and those with little work history, education or skills, long-term unemployment is growing most rapidly among white-collar and college-educated workers with long work experience, studies have found, making the problem difficult for policymakers to address even as it grows more urgent.</br></br>""What has happened is a polarization of the labor market. It was very strong at the very top and very strong until recently at the bottom,"" said Lawrence F. Katz, a labor economist at Harvard University. ""But in the recent weak recovery, and now recession, demand has been very weak"" for jobs in the middle.</br></br>Caroline Dixon never contemplated any of that when she resigned in April after nine months as a program officer with the Spina Bifida Association. She left because the job was ""a bad fit,"" and she said she was confident that the economy was strong and she would soon find work. For a long time, she never stopped in the unemployment office on Naylor Road near her Southeast Washington home."
"It seems like a contradiction.

"The draft recommendations of the president's commission on deficit reduction call for closing popular tax deductions, higher gas taxes and other revenue raisers to drive tax collections up to 21% of GDP from the historical norm of about 18.5%. Another plan, proposed last week by commission member and former Congressional Budget Office director Alice Rivlin, would impose a 6.5% national sales tax on consumers.</br></br>The claim here, echoed by endless purveyors of conventional wisdom in Washington, is that these added revenues -- potentially a half-trillion dollars a year -- will be used to reduce the $8 trillion to $10 trillion deficits in the coming decade. If history is any guide, however, that won't happen. Instead, Congress will simply spend the money.</br></br>In the late 1980s, one of us, Richard Vedder, and Lowell Gallaway of Ohio University co-authored a often-cited research paper for the congressional Joint Economic Committee (known as the $1.58 study) that found that every new dollar of new taxes led to more than one dollar of new spending by Congress. Subsequent revisions of the study over the next decade found similar results.</br></br>We've updated the research. Using standard statistical analyses that introduce variables to control for business-cycle fluctuations, wars and inflation, we found that over the entire post World War II era through 2009 each dollar of new tax revenue was associated with $1.17 of new spending. Politicians spend the money as fast as it comes in -- and a little bit more.</br></br>We also looked at different time periods (e.g., 1947-2009 vs. 1959-2009), different financial data (fiscal year federal budget data, as well as calendar year National Income and Product Account data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis), different lag structures (e.g., relating taxes one year to spending change the following year to allow for the time it takes bureaucracies to spend money), different control variables, etc. The alternative models produce different estimates of the tax-spend relationship -- between $1.05 and $1.81. But no matter how we configured the data and no matter what variables we examined, higher tax collections never resulted in less spending."

Gaylord and HiBall Events, which work together to stage the $750,000 event, began planning almost as soon as the confetti was swept up last January. On Wednesday, they set up 15 party areas throughout the cavernous hotel and convention center, with such themes as shamrocks and Mardi Gras. That left Thursday to cook 500 pounds of pasta, 1,500 pounds of chicken, 900 pounds of roast beef and 5,000 shrimp for the gala, for which tickets cost $110 to $210 per person.</br></br>""We start by cooking the pasta in 80-gallon kettles; then we can make something like 400 gallons of sauce,"" said executive chef Rigoberto Lemus.

"If the Clinton administration is serious about a no-pain reduction of 100,000 federal jobs in the next few years, Congress will have to come up with a multibillion-dollar buyout program to persuade older workers to leave and to protect the jobs of less senior employees.</br></br>This year, more than 111,000 federal workers got the opportunity to retire early. For people under the civil service retirement plan, that meant being able to get an immediate (but sometimes reduced) pension at age 50 after 20 years of service, or at any age after 25 years of service. Normally, workers would have to be age 55 with 30 years of service to retire.</br></br>The U.S. Postal Service solved its overstaffing problems with money, offering employees six months of pay if they would take early or regular retirement within a limited time frame. More than 47,000 took the buyout, including 26,800 (27 percent of the eligibles) who took early retirement.</br></br>Agencies that couldn't offer cash buyouts found the early- retirement program a flop. Less than 5 percent of the eligibles left.</br></br>Next year, Defense will offer about 3,000 of its 1 million civilians a modified buyout: an award of as much as $20,000 if a worker quits or retires early at a base or office that is not being closed.

"Despite nervousness about tomorrow's U.S. trade report, many analysts contend that interest rates should remain stable in the near future.</br></br>The unpredictable monthly trade report always is a market wild card. But analysts believe the bond market already has discounted a widening of the trade gap in April. And, they add, there also is a lot of other potential bad news built into the markets, including the fear that inflation is accelerating because of rising commodity prices.</br></br>Thus, many forecasters predict the yield on the U.S. Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue probably will stay close to current levels in coming weeks. The Treasury's bellwether 9 1/8% bonds due 2018 were quoted late Friday at 9.04%, down slightly from 9.05% Thursday.</br></br>""Interest rates will take a breather"" over the next month or two, contended A.C. Moore, senior vice president and director of research at Argus Research Corp.

"NEW YORK -- Bond prices rallied yesterday amid widespread speculation that the Federal Reserve System soon will announce a long-awaited cut in its discount rate.</br></br>Those hopes grew yesterday after West Germany's central bank reduced its discount rate to 3 1/2% from 4%, effective today.

Short-term interest rates fell.</br></br>""It looks like the Fed is about to lower its discount rate at long last,"" said David M. Jones, an economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Co. The discount rate, the fee the Fed charges on loans to banks and savings institutions, has been 7 1/2% since last May.</br></br>The move could come as early as this afternoon, Mr. Jones said. He also predicted that banks will quickly follow with a reduction in their prime, or base, rate on corporate loans to 9% from 9 1/2%.

"If your mutual fund portfolio hasn't been performing as well as you think it should and you're not sure why, it may be time for a bit of spring cleaning.</br></br>A cluttered investment lineup is inefficient at best and costly at worst. By identifying overlapping holdings and gaps in your asset- allocation plan, you may be able to cut your expenses and boost your total return. If your mutual fund garage needs a clean sweep, here is a checklist of 10 things to consider:</br></br>What's your goal, and are you on track to reach it? Everybody's got dreams, but we don't always articulate them when we're investing, which financial planners say is a big mistake. Identify your goals -- saving for retirement, a college education or your dream home -- figure out how long it will take and how much you'll need to achieve them and set up individual accounts for each. Keep your eyes on the prize by regularly checking your progress. If you're not on target, you may have to invest more or take on more risk.</br></br>Too often people invest first and think about why later, or not at all, said Percy E. Bolton, a financial planner in Pasadena, Calif. ""Sometimes it's like you have to be a psychologist . . . you have to discover people's goals,"" Bolton said. ""If an account has no goal, you don't know what you're working toward. So when you go to invest, anything will do, and you're left just hoping it will do okay.""</br></br>Is your portfolio diversified? You may hold a lot of funds, but that doesn't mean all your eggs aren't in one basket. Planners say people often pile into the types of funds that have worked well for them in the past or whatever they think will bring the highest return and wind up short in other areas, such as fixed income, which can provide important protection in down markets. A better strategy is to own a bit of everything."
"REGULAR REBALANCING is good. But even less would be better.</br></br>Around this time each year, many folks nudge their mutual-fund portfolio back into shape by lightening up on winning funds and adding to lackluster performers. And that's a smart thing to do.</br></br>It turns out, however, that rebalancing can be even more profitable if it's done less often. Here's why you should scale back your real- estate investment trusts and your small-stock holdings -- but leave your growth stocks and your Japan fund to run.</br></br>-- Reining in risk. Building and maintaining a fund portfolio can be reduced to three simple steps. First, pick the market segments you want to invest in and decide how much you will stash in each.</br></br>You might settle on a mix of, say, 30% large U.S. stocks, 10% small U.S. companies, 5% REITs, 10% developed foreign-stock markets, 5% emerging-market shares, 5% gold stocks, 25% high-quality U.S. bonds, 5% high-yield junk bonds and 5% foreign bonds."

"Author: Gary S. Becker, George P. Shultz ; John B. Taylor</br></br>Wanted: A strategy for economic growth, full employment, and deficit reduction--all without inflation. Experience shows how to get there. Credible actions that reduce the rapid growth of federal spending and debt will raise economic growth and lower the unemployment rate. Higher private investment, not more government purchases, is the surest way to increase prosperity.</br></br>When private investment is high, unemployment is low. In 2006, investment--business fixed investment plus residential investment--as a share of GDP was high, at 17%, and unemployment was low, at 5%. By 2010 private investment as a share of GDP was down to 12%, and unemployment was up to more than 9%. In the year 2000, investment as a share of GDP was 17% while unemployment averaged around 4%. This is a regular pattern.</br></br>In contrast, higher government spending is not associated with lower unemployment. For example, when government purchases of goods and services came down as a share of GDP in the 1990s, unemployment didn't rise. In fact it fell, and the higher level of government purchases as a share of GDP since 2000 has clearly not been associated with lower unemployment.</br></br>To the extent that government spending crowds out job-creating private investment, it can actually worsen unemployment. Indeed, extensive government efforts to stimulate the economy and reduce joblessness by spending more have failed to reduce joblessness."
"Richard Baker, a big investor in shopping centers and retailers, raised $400 million in 2007 for a ""blank-check company"" that would buy operating businesses like restaurants and casinos. But he didn't do a deal as the economy fell off a cliff.</br></br>Now he has another strategy that is being watched closely in the real-estate industry. Instead of returning the money -- which he would be required to do soon if he didn't spend it -- Mr. Baker wants to convert the company, named NRDC Acquisition Corp., into a public real-estate investment trust. The new company, named Retail Opportunity Investments Corp., would be geared toward buying retail properties from distressed owners.</br></br>The move is the latest sign real-estate investors are looking to the public markets for capital at a time banks are reluctant to lend and private capital is scarce. The strategy has paid off for many. Investors have bought more than $15 billion in REIT secondary stock sales so far this year.</br></br>Several companies have completed initial public offerings to raise money to invest in distressed real-estate debt, including Starwood Capital Group LLC's $810 million IPO last month. But Mr. Baker's attempt is different from these ""mortgage REITs"" because he would focus on buying actual properties -- specifically, supermarket-anchored strip shopping centers on the East and West coasts of the U.S. -- rather than the debt behind them.</br></br>If successful, Mr. Baker's attempt could set the stage for other companies to ask stock-market investors to fund blind pools for investing in shopping centers, warehouses, office buildings and other kinds of commercial real estate whose owners face loan defaults."

"More than usual, iron-ore miners are in a hole. And the Australian dollar hasn't thrown down a rope.</br></br>Benchmark iron-ore prices are now $70 a metric ton, down nearly 50% this year. The largest miners of the steel-making commodity, with the lowest costs, have ramped up supply even as demand from China has waned. Iron ore accounted for about 40% of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization at Anglo-Australian miner BHP Billiton in the first six months of the year; at peer Rio Tinto, that figure was nearly 80%.</br></br>Usually, lower prices for Australia's key commodities would go hand in hand with a weaker currency, easing the pain for producers there. The biggest miners price their output and report earnings in U.S. dollars, but their costs for labor, transport and services are denominated in local currency. So a weaker Aussie dollar can effectively reduce costs in U.S.-dollar terms at mines there.</br></br>That hasn't happened this time. The average price of iron ore in the first half of this year was about $110, according to the Steel Index. So far in the second half, it is $86, down about 23%. And while Australia's currency has fallen since early September, on average it has barely budged: Just like in the first half of 2014, one Australian dollar has been worth, on average, US$0.91.</br></br>That makes iron ore's tumble all the tougher. Take Rio Tinto. The miner said in August that a 10% decline in the average iron-ore price would knock about US$1.2 billion off 2014's underlying earnings. But a 10% drop in the Australian dollar would add back about $500 million, mitigating the impact."
"Oddsmakers give the recession a short duration. Even dour Fed chairman Alan Greenspan has detected a few signs of early recovery. But not everyone is yet convinced.</br></br>Clearly, stock and bond investors have hedged their bets: All the averages are way below their optimistic thresholds. The bankruptcies of Enron, Kmart, Global Crossing and others have cast serious doubt about the sustainability of recovery. And lingering in the background is always the threat of another terrorist attack, Mideast war, or Third World currency collapse.</br></br>As Joseph Stiglitz, chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors and later chief economist for the World Bank, warned way back in November, this recession might turn out to be the worst in 20 years. As Professor Stiglitz sees it, a deep recession like 1981-82 is the best we can hope for. In that 16-month recession, output fell by 12.3% and unemployment soared to a post-war high of 10.8%.</br></br>By contrast, in the 1990-91 recession, output fell only 2.3% and unemployment peaked at 6.5%. That is the kind of short, shallow recession the optimists are hoping for this time around.</br></br>Despite the spate of warning signs, the optimistic outlook still remains strong. The optimists' case rests not only on the usual array of indicators -- rising consumer confidence, abnormally low inventories, cheap money, and fiscal stimulus -- but also on a wild card few observers have noticed."

""There's a high degree of uncertainty ... there's a huge risk that they won't.""</br></br>Kohn added the U.S. political system has become ""soap opera-ized"" with such a huge gulf between the country's political parties there is a real risk debt and deficit will continue to grow past the end of this year.</br></br>He said governments worldwide must not rely on central bankers to get them off the hook for uncomfortable choices.</br></br>""You cannot count on central bank purchases to bail out governments whatever the inflationary consequences,"" Kohn said."
"At JP Foodservice, Jim Miller has a simple motto for the future of his company: Don't bite off more than you can chew.</br></br>Miller, chief executive of JP Foodservice Inc., a Columbia company that went public in November, is mapping out a plan for his Maryland company that involves methodical growth that would gradually expand the company's geographic base without straining its purse strings.</br></br>The company used the $86 million it received from its public offering to pay down a chunk of its heavy debt load. It still has $159 million in debt, but much of that has been refinanced at lower interest rates. Analysts say that the company is poised to emerge from a string of quarterly losses caused by its high debt service.</br></br>The company was a subsidiary of Sara Lee Corp. before a management-led leveraged buyout in July 1989. Today, it is considered the sixth-largest food distributor in the United States--and the largest based in the Washington area, analysts say. Company-wide, it employs 2,300 people.</br></br>It distributes food products, such as canned and baked goods, produce and meats, to restaurants, hotels and cafeterias in 25 states and the District. But, unlike some food distribution companies, JP Food service deals in much more than just food. It also distributes other products, including detergents and plastic and metal utensils."
"While the incomes of most American households have remained stubbornly flat over the past three decades, the elderly have seen their financial circumstances improve dramatically, far outpacing every other demographic group, the Census Bureau reported yesterday.</br></br>An analysis of household income from 1969 to 1996 showed a 57 percent rise in real median income for married couples over age 65, dwarfing the 6.3 percent increase for all households. Among elderly people living alone, incomes went up even more -- 63 percent.</br></br>The improvements can be traced largely to increases in Social Security benefits and pensions, but also reflect a generation that enjoyed the combined effect of the G.I. Bill that gave many more college educations, a booming real estate market and the entry of more women into the labor force.</br></br>These changes, said Martin Corry, director of federal affairs at the American Association of Retired Persons, ""have meant light-years of difference for that whole generation.""</br></br>In fact, the result has been to create a very different profile of retirement and aging. As late as the 1960s, many elderly ended up in county homes for the aged, a bed of last resort for those without income, family or health care coverage. Now, most older Americans are able to either live at home or, in a small but growing number of cases, move into retirement communities and assisted living facilities that enable them to live more active lives."
"The Federal Reserve yesterday granted a request by American Express to become a bank holding company, opening the door for the credit card giant to accept deposits and permanently access financing from the Fed.</br></br>The approval represented the latest reshaping of the financial services industry, which is undergoing its worst credit crisis in decades. In announcing the action, the Fed cited ""emergency conditions.""</br></br>The Fed's approval for American Express and American Express Travel Related Services was similar to a decision it made in September to transform the country's two biggest investment banks, Goldman Sachs Group and Morgan Stanley, into bank holding companies.</br></br>That move bolstered the two institutions after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history.</br></br>Like American Express, Goldman and Morgan Stanley gained the ability to borrow federal money and build a base of deposits in an effort to reassure investors and other banks."
"The U.S. dollar firmed slightly against most major foreign currencies yesterday in trading that was sharply curtailed by the closing of U.S. markets for the Fourth of July holiday.</br></br>Trading in Europe, Canada and the Far East was trendless, with foreign-exchange traders attributing the dollar's slight gains to a feeling that its decline in the U.S. on Wednesday was slightly overdone.</br></br>In Frankfurt, the dollar rose to more than 3.04 West German marks in early trading, but eased after the West German central bank's council met and took no action on interest rates. Some observers had expected the council to ease one or another of the central bank's key interest rates after Karl Otto Poehl, president of the bank, had said earlier this week there was ""downside maneuvering room"" for West German interest rates.</br></br>Most West German interest rates now are only slightly lower than U.S. interest rates, which has lessened the attractiveness of dollar-denominated investments.</br></br>In late European trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 3.0355 marks, slightly above the late New York quote of 3.0320 marks on Wednesday. The British pound, benefiting from interest rates that are higher than those in the U.S., was the only major currency to strengthen against the dollar, firming to $1.3150 in London yesterday from $1.3145 in New York on Wednesday."
"Author: Michael A. Pollock</br></br>As rising prices of oil and other commodities fan fears about inflation, many investors have been stocking up on U.S. Treasury inflation-protected securities or shares of mutual funds that invest in those securities.</br></br>The principal value and interest payments of TIPS rise along with any increase in the consumer-price index. And, of course, Treasury debt of all kinds is considered to be among the safest of investments, an advantage over alternative ways of buffering a portfolio against inflation.</br></br>But some investment managers argue that TIPS alone aren't the ideal solution in an environment, like the current one, in which interest rates could be poised to rise significantly as inflation accelerates. That's because sharply higher interest rates would eat into the value of TIPS in an investor's portfolio.</br></br>A better approach, they say, is to mix TIPS with other assets that also have inflation-protection benefits but won't be as sensitive to interest-rate movements. These may include such things as riskier bonds that offer yields far above the current inflation rate, and natural-resources stocks and real-estate securities, which may appreciate further as economic growth heats up."

"WASHINGTON -- One of President Reagan's longstanding beliefs is that the government can reduce its deficit by mining uncollected revenues from the underground economy. The Treasury's proposal to simplify tax laws and lower income tax rates will get at some of the ""$100 billion of tax that is avoided in the United States"" each year, he contends.</br></br>Over the last four years Congress and the administration have taken a number of steps to police tax evasion and slow the growth of the underground or ""off-book"" economy, where transactions often take place in cash and aren't reported to the Internal Revenue Service. The Treasury believes these actions already are starting to reduce tax cheating, although the IRS doesn't have much evidence to back this up yet. Reducing the complexity and perceived inequity of the tax system would increase compliance further, the Treasury argues. Virtue would be its own reward: A fairer tax system would boost economic efficiency and make tax evasion less attractive.</br></br>The underground economy has intrigued economists and politicians since the mid-seventies, when some analysts began to notice a sharp increase in evidence of subterranean activity -- which ranges from dope dealing to a carpenter's failure to report income from moonlighting. Analysts theorized that the increase in unreported income was a response to rising inflation, which forced many taxpayers into higher tax brackets, and growing disenchantment with the complexity of the tax system.</br></br>Since there's no uniform definition of the underground economy, economists disagree sharply about how to measure it and how to gauge its impact on the nation's output, employment and savings. Estimates of the subterranean economy's size range from 3% of gross national product, the value of the nation's output of goods and services, to 30%. The government's estimates tend to be at the low end of the range.</br></br>While economists squabble over the size of the underground economy, politicians and tax collectors are unified in their desire to collect their share of these unreported revenue streams. IRS studies show that tax cheating is a huge, endemic problem."
"The 2001 recession, already among the mildest in modern U.S. economic history, was even slightly shallower than earlier estimated, according to a comprehensive revision of national income and production figures released yesterday by the Commerce Department.</br></br>The drop in the nation's gross domestic product from the first quarter of 2001 to the fourth quarter, when the recession ended, was only 0.5 percent rather than 0.6 percent, according to the revisions, which are done every five years. However, the update also shows that the economy contracted slightly in the July-September period of 2000, as well as in the first three quarters of 2001.</br></br>The latest figures revised were those for the second quarter of this year. For the third quarter, the department has estimated that the economy grew at an 8.2 percent annual rate after adjustment for inflation, but it will revise that figure late this month.</br></br>The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis, which is responsible for producing the national income and GDP numbers, altered several definitions and methodologies in an effort to track the rapid changes in the complex U.S. economy. The new figures paint much the same picture as the old ones -- for the past 10 years, the average growth rate of the economy is still 3.2 percent a year -- but several important details for the past year or two are different.</br></br>For example, U.S. corporate profits last year were $904.2 billion, nearly $120 billion higher than previously estimated. The upward revision was primarily the result of an adjustment in the treatment of stock options and when they are reported as an expense on corporate books. In the second quarter of this year, this profit measure, which is adjusted for capital consumption and inventory gains, was $1.0228 trillion on an annualized basis."
"Gold prices sank to a six-week low on Thursday as signs of improving U.S. economic growth and easing concerns about Ukraine sapped investor interest in the haven asset.</br></br>Gold for April delivery, the most active contract, fell $8.70, or 0.7%, to $1,294.70 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. This was gold's lowest settlement price since Feb. 11, when futures closed at $1,295 an ounce.</br></br>Gold had rallied over the first two months of 2014 as investors sought to protect their wealth from risks such as a slowing U.S. economy, turbulence in emerging markets, and a political crisis in Ukraine. Gold is considered by some traders as a safer investment than currencies or Treasury bonds, because the precious metal's value isn't tied to a government or country.</br></br>But after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in mid-March, some of the uncertainty surrounding the geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe appeared to subside and gold prices turned lower. Futures are now on track to post a 2% loss for March.</br></br>""If you're a gold bull, you have to be disappointed with what's happened,"" said Bill O'Neill, a principal with commodities investment company Logic Advisors. ""To go from $1,380 to $1,290 and change in a very brief time shows that this market doesn't have very much momentum,"" he added."
"Beijing -- A CREDIT SQUEEZE gripping one of China's biggest investment companies is spooking investors and raising questions about the way business is being done in the country's stock markets. But there may be some buying opportunities for the brave-hearted.</br></br>D'Long International Strategic Investment, founded in 1986 by four siblings named Tang from China's northwestern region of Xinjiang, rode years of easy credit to become one of the country's largest private conglomerates. Its holdings include one of the world's biggest tomato- paste makers, China's foremost heavy-truck manufacturer, and U.S. lawn-equipment company Murray. D'Long has stakes in more than 100 Chinese companies, including a dozen securities firms and commercial banks.</br></br>This spring, Beijing's credit-tightening measures -- aimed at cooling a hot economy -- coupled with Chinese media reports questioning D'Long's financial health sent share prices of some of the company's listed affiliates spiraling. The developments set off a chain reaction that threatened to bring down the Tangs' empire and damped already-weak investor confidence in China's stock market. It also shined a spotlight on questionable practices that are seen as widespread in China's financial industry, from stock-price manipulation to the use of price-inflated shares as collateral for bank loans.</br></br>D'Long's predicament ""tells us that there still exist big loopholes in China's equity-market structure and corporate governance,"" says Zhang Yong, an analyst for Great Wall Securities.</br></br>Chinese prosecutors haven't charged D'Long with any wrongdoing, and there isn't any indication that the siblings have broken any laws. Some banks and other creditors have filed lawsuits against D'Long, however, and a Shanghai judge involved says the situation ""is under further investigation."" Some Chinese media have suggested that D'Long ramped up stock prices and then tapped its financial institutions for funding to finance its ambitious expansion -- allegations that company executives have denied."
"Did Mitt Romney and Bain Capital help office-supply retailer Staples create 88,000 jobs? 43,000? 252? Actually, Staples probably destroyed 100,000 jobs while creating millions of new ones.</br></br>Since 1986, Staples has opened 2,000 stores, eliminating the jobs of distributors and brokers who charged nasty markups for paper and office supplies. But it enabled hundreds of thousands of small (and not so small) businesses to stock themselves cheaply and conveniently and expand their operations.</br></br>It's the same story elsewhere. Apple employs just 47,000 people, and Google under 25,000. Like Staples, they have destroyed many old jobs, like making paper maps and pink ""While You Were Out"" notepads. But by lowering the cost of doing business they've enabled innumerable entrepreneurs to start new businesses and employ hundreds of thousands, even millions, of workers world-wide -- all while capital gets redeployed more effectively.</br></br>This process happens during every business cycle and always, always creates jobs. Yet is ignored by policy mavens.</br></br>It is now four years after the wheels fell off our financial system. The government has tried every gimmick to revive the economy: fiscal stimulus, monetary easing, loan write-downs, foreclosure modifications -- all duds. It seems like no one remembers how an economy creates jobs anymore. The right answer, in fact the only answer, for jobs and better living standards, is productivity."

"In the summer of 1965, one of the most explosive government reports ever written disclosed that one-quarter of all black children were born out of wedlock.</br></br>The report, by then-Assistant Labor Secretary Daniel Patrick Moynihan, touched off waves of alarm, then defensiveness, then recrimination. The subject proved so sensitive that public policy-makers became convinced there was nothing they could do to address it. Eventually, a protective silence descended.</br></br>Twenty-five years later, there is a new statistic: More than one-quarter of all children born in America are born out of wedlock.</br></br>The black out-of-wedlock rate has more than doubled to 63.5 percent (in 1988, the last year for which figures are available).

"NEW YORK -- Something strange is afoot in the mortgage market -- and it is causing home buyers to fork over more money.</br></br>By all accounts, rates on mortgages should be tumbling. That is because mortgage rates typically track interest rates on long-term bonds, which have been falling since the beginning of the year.</br></br>But mortgage rates have remained essentially flat, causing the gap between mortgage rates and bond yields to widen by the largest measure in years. Unfortunately for home buyers, this trend comes just at the beginning of the spring buying season, when activity in the residential real-estate market peaks.</br></br>Freddie Mac, the mortgage servicer, said yesterday that the rate for a 30-year-fixed-rate mortgage averaged 8.20% this week. While down slightly from 8.23% last week, it isn't much different from three months ago, when the average rate was 8.15%. During the same period, yields on 10-year Treasury notes, most frequently used to set mortgage rates, have fallen to about 5.9% from about 6.5%. (They were quoted at 5.915% late yesterday.)</br></br>On a $200,000 mortgage, the difference between an 8.2% rate and a 7.6% rate is about $84 a month on a 30-year conventional fixed-rate mortgage."
"Again following the lead of the bond market, the stock market yesterday finished moderately lower after failing to extend its late blue-chip rally from Monday.

The transportation indicator also fell, but the utility average posted a small rise.</br></br>The downturn was less apparent in the broader market than in the industrial average. New York Stock Exchange losers led gainers by only about 7-to-6. A big part of the industrial average's setback was accounted for by Merck, which skidded 4 5/8 to 86 1/8 in active trading.</br></br>""The psychology of the market is dominated by interest rates, as illustrated by the sharp rally on Monday when bond prices rose and the lack of follow-through (yesterday) when the bond market faltered,"" commented Michael T. Murray, vice president of Loomis Sayles, Chicago."
"To the market's surprise the most recent Federal Open Market Committee statement didn't even hint at the threats implicit in the rise in commodity prices, especially oil, or the dollar's fall. These events have lowered the threat of deflation to virtually zero, but the Fed insists that deflation is still a slightly higher risk than inflation. Is the Fed keeping its head in the sand? Is Alan Greenspan bowing to George Bush and the upcoming election? Even before the Fed meeting, an increasing number of commentators insisted the Fed is too easy. Now such criticism has reached a crescendo.</br></br>On the surface, the censure seems justified. Commodity prices are rapidly increasing; the Commodity Research Bureau index of actively traded commodities is now at a level not seen since the inflation bubble of 1980. Oil stays stubbornly high, near $40 per barrel, and the Journal of Commerce Index of lightly processed commodities, once a favorite Greenspan indicator, has soared to an all-time high. And although the dollar has stabilized, it is down 25% against a basket of currencies since early 2002. Finally, the real Fed funds rate has been negative for two years and relative to real economic growth, the most negative since the inflationary '70s.</br></br>But there are good responses to these points. The rising commodity prices are due to China, which is churning out lower priced goods that keep inflation in check. The dollar has indeed dropped, but two years ago economists were saying it was too high. Today it's at, or just below, its purchasing power parity level, consistent with the persistent current account deficit. Furthermore, the smart money in the oil futures market says that the price is coming down sharply. And there is also a good response to the low real rates, a key variable in the critics' argument. Inflation hawks have maintained that by keeping the after-inflation cost of money negative, the Fed is feeding the fires of future inflation.</br></br>But if monetary policy were really too accommodating, wouldn't we see rising interest rates in the bond market? Yet with the 10-year bond yield under 4%, we see no such concern. Are those calling for higher rates saying that the bond vigilantes -- who have kept government and the Fed honest by pushing bond prices lower when the Fed's action has been inflationary -- are flat out wrong? That would be a sharp reversal from the past when the bond market was routinely praised for warning errant governments of monetary and fiscal profligacy.</br></br>With the 10-year indexed bond yielding a record-low 1.4%, a zero or even negative real Fed funds rate -- what we have now -- looks about right. If the Fed raised short-term rates, it would risk flattening or inverting the yield curve, something very dangerous early in a recovery."
"Foreign-exchange traders, who have been divided the past couple of weeks about whether the U.S. dollar would weaken or strengthen, now appear convinced that the currency is once again headed upward.</br></br>Their view was reinforced yesterday when, despite the absence of the U.S. and Canada from the currency market for the Labor Day holiday, the dollar soared in European trading to 2.9120 West German marks, the highest level since Aug. 7, when the dollar hit an 11-year high of 2.9255 marks in New York.</br></br>""This new pattern of strength will be carried over into the U.S. when trading resumes (today),"" said Ronald H. Holzer, an assistant vice president and chief dealer of Harris Trust & Savings Bank, Chicago. Mr. Holzer said the dollar took off yesterday after rising through a technical resistance point at 2.8940 marks. Stronger Eurodollar interest rates and expectations of rising U.S. interest rates, which make dollar-denominated investments more attractive, were responsible for the general dollar strength, he added.</br></br>At the London afternoon gold fixing yesterday, gold declined to $344.50 an ounce from the morning fixing of $346.20 and from the Friday close of $348.40 on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Traders said the dollar's strength in Europe was responsible.</br></br>In early trading in Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at $344.25 an ounce."
"The Dow Jones industrial average briefly swept past 12,000 for the first time Wednesday, extending its march into record territory but falling short of the benchmark close.</br></br>The index surpassed the milestone shortly after trading began, rising as high as 12,049.51, before pulling back as the market's initial wave of enthusiasm dissipated and investors cashed in some gains.</br></br>The Dow closed Wednesday at 11,992.68, up 42.66, or 0.36 percent. The previous closing high of 11,980.60 was set Monday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.91, or 0.14 percent, to 1365.96. The Nasdaq composite index fell 7.80, or 0.33 percent, to 2337.15.</br></br>It took the Dow 71/2 years to make the trip from 11,000, having been pummeled during that time by the dot-com bust, recession and the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In the spring of 1999, during the Internet boom, it took the Dow 24 days to sprint to 11,000 from 10,000.</br></br>The Dow's quick move past 12,000 Wednesday came after a Labor Department report indicated that consumer price pressures are leveling off and as third-quarter earnings reports from major companies bolstered investors' confidence."
"The country's growing unemployment is overtaking subprime mortgages as the main driver of foreclosures, according to bankers and economists, threatening to send even higher the number of borrowers who will lose their homes and making the foreclosure crisis far more complicated to unwind.</br></br>Economists estimate that 1.8 million borrowers will lose their homes this year, up from 1.4 million last year, according to Moody's Economy.com. And the government, which has already committed billions of dollars to foreclosure-prevention efforts, has found it far more difficult to help people who have lost their paychecks than those whose mortgage payments became unaffordable because of an interest-rate increase.</br></br>""It's a much harder nut to crack, unemployment,"" said Mark A. Calabria, director of financial regulation studies at the Cato Institute. ""It's much easier to bash lenders than to create jobs.""</br></br>During the first three months of this year, the largest share of foreclosures shifted from subprime loans to prime loans, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The change to prime loans -- traditionally considered safer -- reflects the growing numbers of unemployed who are being caught up in the foreclosure process, economists say.</br></br>Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has proposed using $2 billion in government rescue funding to provide emergency loans to these borrowers. ""We are going to be seeing more foreclosures because of prolonged unemployment,"" he said. ""These are people who weren't in trouble and wouldn't be in trouble if they hadn't lost their job."""
"Machine-tool producers booked 55% more orders in March than a year earlier, boosting the 1988 first-quarter total to the highest level for any quarter since the 1981-82 recession.</br></br>Brisk buyer-inquiry rates indicate continued good business for at least the remainder of this year, machine-tool builders say.</br></br>Domestic producers of these complex machines, which are used by durable-goods manufacturers to shape metal parts, received $254.4 million of orders in March, up from $164.2 million a year earlier, the National Machine Tool Builders' Association said.</br></br>In the first quarter, orders totaled $850 million, up 83% from the 1987 initial period, the association said, and the highest quarterly total since the $867 million of the second quarter of 1981. Several large General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. orders in January and February contributed to the unusually strong quarter, but demand is broadly based.</br></br>""We had a fantastic March,"" says Christopher C. Cole, vice president, machine tools for Cincinnati Milacron Inc., the nation's largest producer. ""We had strong automotive orders and strong aerospace orders. And our export business is going strong."""
"NEW YORK, Feb. 17 (AP)‰ÛÓStock market averages posted record highs today as selected blue chips, airlines, savings-and-loans and tobaccos advanced. Trading was fairly active.</br></br>It was another irregular rise, ah mg three motors were losers. Utilities and nonferrous metals were mostly lower. Drugs and chemicals declined irregularly.</br></br>Among the 1327 issues traded, however, gainers outnumbered losers by 570 to 497. New highs for 1963-‰Ûª64 totaled 60 and new lows 13.</br></br>Instrumental in the rise of the averages were gains of 3% for Eastman Kodak, 1% for Sears, Roebuck (ex dividend) and Yz for Standard Oil (New Jersey).</br></br>Eastman Kodak still was responding to rumors of a stock split when directors meet Thursday. Sears was said to benefit from institutional buying."
"It is quite a trick for something to grow larger and at the same time become more invisible. But that is what's happening to the health care problem in the United States. The greater the number of people without medical insurance, the less the politicians want to talk about it -- let alone deal with it.</br></br>In 1992, when the plight of the uninsured became a major issue in the presidential campaign, there were 38 million non-covered Americans below Medicare age. Five years later, according to a report released last week, the number had grown by 5 million. And the rate of increase is accelerating, from an average of half a million annually in the first two years to an average of 1.2 million annually in the three most recent years.</br></br>But last week, when the National Coalition on Health Care, a bipartisan group headed by former presidents Bush, Carter and Ford, put out its latest report on ""The Erosion of Health Insurance Coverage in the United States,"" it barely made a ripple. Monica Lewinsky's appearance on ""Saturday Night Live"" drew more coverage than the fact that in the most recent year cited by the report, 1.7 million Americans were added to the ranks of the uninsured.</br></br>Why is this happening? The report's authors, Steven Findlay and Joel Miller -- who had the assistance of Tulane University's Kenneth Thorpe, probably the country's leading authority on this question -- say the legions of the uninsured are rising because of fundamental economic and demographic forces, which, by themselves, are certain to make the problem worse. The authors say that ""even if the rosy economic conditions prevalent since 1992 prevail for another decade, a projected 52 million to 54 million non-elderly Americans -- one in five -- will be uninsured in 2009."" If a recession occurs, that number likely will jump to 61 million -- one in four.</br></br>Most of the uninsured have jobs, but increasingly, they work in small businesses or in service sectors that either do not cover employees or require them to pay so much for health insurance that they cannot afford it. The growing numbers of self-employed, part- timers and contract workers swell the totals."
"In the nearly 16 years that I've been writing this column, I've never seen a better market in which to be a first-time home buyer.</br></br>The rising tide of foreclosures has pushed down home prices significantly over the past 18 months. Homes, relative to income, are about at the historic norm, which means they're more affordable than they've been in at least a decade.</br></br>Beyond that, if you buy a foreclosed property, you might wind up spending even less, as lenders struggle to process all of the foreclosures and short sales that are piling up. (If there were no more foreclosures in Florida, it would take the courts nearly two years to process all of the foreclosures on the docket today.)</br></br>Not only have homes come down in price significantly, but 30-year fixed-rate loans are at about 5 percent. Some first-time buyers are getting 15-year rates at 4.5 percent or lower. These are historically low interest rates that will seem downright cheap if rates rise above 7 percent, which they will probably do several years from now.</br></br>Spending less to finance a property means you can get more for your money or save more for retirement or other purposes. With interest rates so low and home prices falling, homeownership becomes affordable to many first-time home buyers."
"Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke yesterday blamed loose lending for the recent turmoil in the mortgage market and told Congress that ""it's worth looking at"" the idea of creating a law against certain lending practices.</br></br>Bernanke, testifying at a hearing of Congress's Joint Economic Committee, said Fed policymakers are likely to hold interest rates steady for a while and are more concerned about high inflation than slow economic growth. Stock prices fell as his comments dispelled many investors' hopes that the central bank was preparing to cut interest rates to bolster a weakening expansion.</br></br>The Fed chairman used the hearing to make his first public remarks on why more Americans are falling behind on their mortgage payments and losing their homes to foreclosure, particularly subprime borrowers with poor credit histories, low incomes, no down payments or other factors that put them at higher risk of default. The hearing comes as Congress is trying to assess the causes and figure out what to do in response.</br></br>Bernanke's testimony was also his first since a Senate Banking Committee hearing last week, at which panel chairman Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) blamed the subprime mortgage mess on a failure of the Fed and other bank regulators to enforce federal lending laws.</br></br>The Fed chairman, without explicitly referring to Dodd's criticisms, countered yesterday that lenders had insufficiently gauged many subprime borrowers' ability to repay mortgages, particularly when their payments increase because of rising interest rates."
"When Nena Razmara was laid off in November from her $70,000-a-year job with a high-end residential building supplier, she thought she would be working again by Christmas.</br></br>Having worked in residential construction for 20 years, she was used to finding work by flipping through her Rolodex.</br></br>The 45-year-old Woodbridge resident made her three phone calls. Then three more. But she still had no leads. For the first time since she graduated from college in the 1980s, she scoured help-wanted ads. She sent out more than 150 resumes and posted one on Craigslist under the heading, ""I desperately need a job.""</br></br>In ordinary times, a college degree goes a long way toward securing employment, even during a recession. It also offers some measure of job security: Workers with at least a college diploma are less likely to lose their jobs in down times. But college grads such as Razmara are now finding that a postsecondary education isn't necessarily enough.</br></br>In fact, labor economists say the unemployment rate for workers with a bachelor's degree or higher is poised to hit a record high. This recession is so far-reaching, they contend, few are immune from the consequences."
"Since J.P. Morgan founded U.S. Steel Corp. in 1901, the alliance of steelmakers and bankers has been an intimate one. But that once-stable relationship appears headed for the rocks as lenders increasingly fret over their exposure in the troubled industry.</br></br>Last month's bankruptcy-law filing by Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. and Armco Inc.'s near-bankruptcy only exacerbated already-strained ties between capital and industry. They also illustrated the turbulence and heightened risk in steel lending.</br></br>Not long ago, the unraveling of the steel industry would have seemed unthinkable both to producers and bankers alike. But cheap foreign imports, high labor costs, obsolete hardware and the dwindling demand for steel have ravaged steelmakers, shattering their lenders' smokestack orientation.</br></br>Although loans to the industry pale next to the enormity of Latin debt, steel industry bankers find themselves in vulnerable positions. Most major U.S. lenders already are carrying large portfolios of shaky foreign loans, and their capital-to-assets ratios scarcely meet federal regulatory guidelines.</br></br>Money-center banks are reassessing major steelmakers as credit risks, while some lenders have turned to stronger producers such as Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corp., a specialty-steel maker, and Pohang Iron & Steel Co. of Korea, a government-controlled producer. Most banks are seeking to use debt-restructuring talks such as those with Wheeling-Pittsburgh and Armco to strengthen the security for existing loans."
"Wall Street capped a huge week with a sharp advance Friday after the government's employment report for September and its revision of August's data cooled the market's fears of a recession. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index reached a new closing high.</br></br>The S&P 500 index gained 14.75, or 0.96 percent, to 1557.59. Its previous closing high was 1553.08, on July 19. The index, which is the basis of many mutual funds and other investments and used as a benchmark for others, also set a fresh trading high, at 1561.91.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average rose 91.70, or 0.66 percent, to 14,066.01. It set a trading high, at 14,124.54. The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index showed bigger gains, rising 46.75, or 1.71 percent, to 2,780.32.</br></br>The Labor Department's report that employers added 110,000 jobs in September -- essentially what analysts had expected -- reassured Wall Street that the job market wasn't pulling back sharply, as was feared a month ago. Though the data appeared to lessen the likelihood of an interest rate cut when the Federal Reserve meets Oct. 30, investors were relieved that the economy does not appear headed for a precipitous slowdown.</br></br>Strength in the job market during a housing downturn and a time of tighter credit conditions has been a pillar of the economy. With consumer spending accounting for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, investors are eager for workers to continue to collect their paychecks."
"Sales at retailers nationwide slumped during last month's back-to- school shopping season, a sign that consumer spending, the main driver of U.S. economic growth, is weak.</br></br>""Without the props from the fiscal-stimulus rebates, consumer spending is slowly caving in,"" said Brian Bethune, chief U.S. financial economist at Global Insight in Lexington, Mass.</br></br>The government's economic-stimulus plan doled out some $107 billion to low- and middle-income Americans earlier this summer in an effort to boost spending. But the gains were fleeting and smaller than hoped. As a result, economists are largely opposed to calls for a second round of stimulus checks, a plan backed by Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama. Republican rival Sen. John McCain has said he is open to a stimulus plan but hasn't committed to any specific proposal.</br></br>Meanwhile, unemployment continues to rise and consumer spending is poised to decline this quarter for the first time since the 1990-91 recession. The decline would be a setback because consumer spending has proved resilient, even increasing during the 2001 recession when many thought it would drop.</br></br>But a combination of falling home prices and stock-market wealth, rising unemployment, stagnant wages and heavy credit-card debt has left consumers in a difficult position. Global Insight expects consumer spending will drop about 1.1% this quarter, and many economists caution that spending could be weak through 2009."
"HSBC Holdings' takeover this week of Mexico's fifth-largest bank offered the latest evidence that South America's financial crisis hasn't soured global perceptions of Mexico, or enthusiasm for investment in that market.</br></br>But some analysts are raising concerns that the stock market faces near-term pressure from the Mexican economy's reliance on the sluggish economy in the U.S., where Mexico sends more than 90% of its exports.</br></br>""The worry for Mexico is U.S. contagion,"" says Christian Stracke, an emerging-markets analyst for the research group CreditSights.</br></br>Indeed, the Mexican government yesterday reported that retail sales fell 0.4% in June from a year earlier, frustrating forecasts that the figure would rise a healthy 2.8%. The news, which dulled some of the optimism from last week's positive gross domestic product numbers for the second quarter, weighed on the stock market. Mexico's IPC Index ended down 0.5% yesterday at 6239.49, despite a rally on Wall Street.</br></br>Asian markets, meanwhile, closed mostly higher, and European stocks bounced back strongly. Overall, the Dow Jones World Stock Index increased 1.03%, or 1.56 points, to 153.14. Excluding the U.S., the index advanced 0.62%, or 0.7 point, to 113.44."
"Banks that lent money to hedge funds and other big risk-takers are asking for some of it back, adding a new dimension to the financial crisis. As the value of mortgage-backed bonds and other investments fall, lenders are demanding that borrowers put up more cash or assets. The resulting selloff by investors is troubling policy makers.</br></br>The number of homes entering foreclosure hit a record in the fourth quarter. Homeowners' share of the equity in their homes fell to 48%.</br></br>---</br></br>The Dow industrials fell 214.60 points, or 1.8%, to 12040.39 amid escalating problems in the bond market. Crude rose 95 cents to a record $105.47 a barrel.</br></br>A Carlyle fund defaulted on loans backing part of its portfolio of U.S. mortgage securities. S&P slashed its ratings on a KKR fund."
