# Course Description and Requirements

## Overview and Prerequisites

This is master's level course on Machine Learning. The objective of the course is for students to gain fundemental proficiency in Machine Learning (ML). This requires knowledge of the problems that ML is expected to solve, knowledge of the models that solve these problems and the programming skills required to implement these models on real world data. In particular, we'll learn how to select models, implement, tune and evaluate machine learning pipelines in Python (using primarly scikit-learn with other packages from Python's data ecosystem). Sucessful students will understand how the fundemental models work and best practices for using them.  

This is a introductory course with respect to ML however core knowledge of mathematics (including algebra, probability and calculus), statistics and programming is expected. We'll ocasionally use some matrix math (arithmetic, algebra and calculus) in lectures, but, most likely, not in the homeworks. We'll also ocasionally reference some material from econometrics that is likely not covered in statistics courses taught outside of economics and related disiplines, but this is unlikely to to present an major obstacle for students from other backgrounds.  

We'll cover the following topics:  

* Object Oriented Programming (as it relates to ML and scikit-learn)
* Linear Regression (including some applied econometrics topics)
* KNN
* Decision/Regression Trees
* Naive Bayes
* Gradient Descent
* Logistic Regression
* Regularization (including LASSO and Ridge)
* Random Forests

Time premitting, we'll also cover some of the following:  

* AdaBoost
* Gradient Boosting
* Dimensionality Reduction
* Clustering Algorithms
* Pratical applications of Neural Networks, LLMs and AI
* Natural Language processing

We we won't cover:

* *Advanced Optimization*: We won't cover advanced optimization techniques, However, we'll cover gradient descent.
* *Neural Networks and "AI"*: However, we'll cover many of thier building blocks and, time premitting, ultilize them through external libraries or APIs for pratical applications.
* *Statisitcal Inference*: We'll primarily be interested in prediction problems rather than inference problems. However, we'll ocasionally discuss inference where it helps us understand and improve our models.
* *MLOps*: However, you'll learn the scikit-learn library and particularly the pipelines interface. If you know application developement, you'll should be able to deploy your models.
* *Explanations Linear Algerbra*: Some models require Linear Algebra for a through treatment. For examples, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We'll not be able to cover these throughly.

_Finally, some student projects may explore some these areas._

## Reading and References

Our primary reference for this class will be _An Introduction to Statistical Learning_ by  which is freely availible from the authors website: https://www.statlearning.com  
If you decide to use a physical copy, which I reccomend, it is fine to use either the R or Python version. The primary content is language agnostic and motivates the material seperatly from its implementation in code. Supplement chapters have selfc ontained programming labs. We'll be following the content closely for the primart content, however we won't follow the labs.  

A supplemental option reference is _Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow_ by Aurélien Géron which offers an approach that focuses on scikit-learn and explains the concepts in the context of the code.  

The Scikit-learn documentation is an excelent resource containing:
* API Documentation
* User Guide[User](https://github.com/edkrueger/eco395m-ml)

If there is a concept that you do not understand, refer to the recommended books. There are many resources, freely available and otherwise.  

That said, the quality of resources, especially the freely available ones, varies tremendously. There is a tremendous amount of bad advice, bad practices and just plain wrong information about coding and data on the internet.
