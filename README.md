# Course Description and Requirements

## Overview and Prerequisites

This is master's level course on Machine Learning. The objective of the course is for students to gain fundamental proficiency in Machine Learning (ML). This requires knowledge of the problems that ML is expected to solve, knowledge of the models that solve these problems and the programming skills required to implement these models on real world data. In particular, we'll learn how to select models, implement, tune and evaluate machine learning pipelines in Python (using primarily scikit-learn with other packages from Python's data ecosystem). Successful students will understand how the fundamental models work and best practices for using them.  

This is an introductory course with respect to ML however core knowledge of mathematics (including algebra, probability and calculus), statistics and programming is expected. We'll occasionally use some matrix math (arithmetic, algebra and calculus) in lectures, but, most likely, not in the homeworks. We'll also occasionally reference some material from econometrics that is likely not covered in statistics courses taught outside of economics and related disciplines, but this is unlikely to present a major obstacle for students from other backgrounds. There are no formal prerequisites.

We'll cover the following topics:  

* Object Oriented Programming (as it relates to ML and scikit-learn)
* Linear Regression (including some applied econometrics topics)
* KNN
* Decision/Regression Trees
* Naive Bayes
* Gradient Descent
* Logistic Regression
* Regularization (including LASSO and Ridge)
* Random Forests

Time permitting, we'll also cover some of the following:  

* Linear Probability Model (LPM)
* Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
* Quardratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
* AdaBoost
* Gradient Boosting
* Dimensionality Reduction
* Clustering Algorithms
* Practical applications of Neural Networks, LLMs and AI
* Natural Language processing

We won't cover:

* *Advanced Optimization*: We won't cover advanced optimization techniques, However, we'll cover gradient descent.
* *Neural Networks and "AI"*: However, we'll cover many of their building blocks and, time permitting, utilize them through external libraries or APIs for practical applications.
* *Statistical Inference*: We will primarily be interested in prediction problems rather than inference problems. However, we will occasionally discuss inference where it helps us understand and improve our models.
* *MLOps*: However, you'll learn the scikit-learn library and particularly the pipelines interface. If you know application development, you should be able to deploy your models.
* *Explanations Linear Algebra*: Some models require Linear Algebra for a thorough treatment. For example, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We'll not be able to cover these thoroughly.

_Finally, some student projects may explore some these areas._

## Reading and References

Our primary reference for this class will be _An Introduction to Statistical Learning_ which is freely available from the authors website: https://www.statlearning.com  
If you decide to use a physical copy, which I recommend, it is fine to use either the R or Python version. The primary content is language agnostic and motivates the material separately from its implementation in code. Supplemental chapters have self contained programming labs. We'll be following the content closely for the primary content, however we won't follow the labs.  

A supplemental optional reference is _Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow_ by Aurélien Géron which offers an approach that focuses on scikit-learn and explains the concepts in the context of the code.  

The Scikit-learn documentation is an excellent resource consisting of three parts:
* [API Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/api/index.html) describing the options for each class and function of the library.
* [User Guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) describing how the algorithms work and the design decisions made in the implementations.
* [Examples](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/index.html) giving a number of examples of how to use many of the models.

If there is a concept that you do not understand, refer to the resources books. Although there are many resources, the quality of resources, especially the freely available ones, varies tremendously. There is a tremendous amount of bad advice, bad practices and just plain wrong information about coding, data and machine learning on the internet.  

## Software

We will use open-source software in this course Python and its packages. We'll also use git. You'll be expected to install Python and Python packages as needed. If needed, the TAs will assist during TA office hours.

In addition, we'll use GitHub. The free plan will be sufficient for this course.  

We'll use Discord as our primary channel for communication for everything except for grades. Announcements will be made on Discord; it is your responsibility to check for them.  

## How to Succeed in This Course

### During Lectures

Lectures will be fast-paced, and you must pay attention in class. When I cover programming content, it can be tempting to replicate every step I take and write the same code I write _while in the lecture_. I don't recommend this as you'll likely fall behind and miss out on new material. During non-programming portions of the course, I expect your computers to be closed. So it may be wise to consider not opening your computer at all during class.  

There is no legitimate reason for you to be on your cell phones during lecture.  

### Outside of Class

If you'd like to go back and try to replicate the work I do in class, you will have a recording of the lectures. Your homework and group projects will provide you with an opportunity to do it yourself.  

After getting the big picture from lectures, I recommend doing the reading and then the homework assignment.  

Please attend office hours.  

### During Group Projects

A large part of the learning during this course will occur during group projects. You'll harden the skills you learned in class, learn new skills and learn how to work on real-world open-ended projects.

We'll set aside class time during group projects to work on them. It's essential that you attend class during these times. It's the only opportunity you will have access to me, the TAs, and your group members _at the same time_. We'll provide advice on scoping your projects, help you make good technical choices and help you troubleshoot complex issues.

## Course Policies

### Grading
Grades will be based on:
* Participation (10%)
* Homework Assignments (20%)
* Midterm Group Project (30%)
* Final Group Project (40%)

Final grades will be determined on the basis of the following rubric.  

Please note: to ensure fairness, all numbers are absolute, and will not be rounded up or down at any stage. Thus a B- will be inclusive of all scores of 80.000 through 83.999.  A = 94-100 A- = 90-93 B+ = 87-89 B = 84-86 B- = 80-83 C+ = 77-79 C = 74-76 C- = 70-73 D+ = 67-69 D = 64-66 D- = 60-63 F = 0-60.  

Grades will be _not_ be curved. Please do not ask me about extra credit or extra work to improve your grade. None will be given.

### Participation

Your participation grade will be based on the extent to which you attend class and participate in your groups' meetings and your attendance during the midterm and final presentations. We won't formally take attendance outside of project work weeks, but excessive tardiness may impact your participation grade. We will take attendance during project work days and presentation days and absence will affect your participation grade.  

Should you have exceptional circumstances where you cannot attend class during project work, you must make arrangements with your group and inform me of these arrangements _in advance_.

### Homework Assignments

* There will be up to 10 homeworks assigned during the semester.
* Homework will not be assigned during project weeks but may be due during them.
* Due dates will be announced as homework is assigned. Homeworks will typically be due a week from when they are assigned. Late homework will _not_ be accepted.
* Homeworks will be submitted in a _private_ Github repository. You must invite the TA(s) and me as collaborators. We'll be able to find your homeworks if you follow the instructions in the assignments. Homework solutions may not be made public. Grades will be posted on Canvas. You will not need to submit homeworks on Canvas.

### Group Projects and Group Project Presentations

* Students will form groups of around five students. (Sizes are subject to change based on enrollment.)
* Students may opt to form different groups for the midterm and final projects.
* Projects will be developed and submitted in public GitHub repositories. You are encouraged to share your projects.
* Projects will be graded based on _both_ group and individual requirements. GitHub will allow us to see who makes which contributions.
* Midterm Projects will be presented in class. Each group will have 5 minutes to present a talk and 5 minutes of Q & A. (Presentation times are subject to change based on enrollment.)
* Final Projects will be presented during the final exam time slot for the course. Each group will have 10 minutes to present their project and 5 minutes of Q & A. (Presentation times are subject to change based on enrollment.)
* You must attend every group's presentation on presentation days, not just your own group's.
* If you know in advance that you have a conflict with one of the presentation dates (e.g., due to travel or religious observance) or require accommodations, please see me as soon as possible to work out an alternative. 
* If you will be absent from a project presentation, you must notify me prior to the presentation at edwardkrueger@utexas.edu. Where advanced notification is not feasible, **the notification must be given by the end of the second day after the absence.** Non-excused absences will result in a zero for that portion of your grade.
